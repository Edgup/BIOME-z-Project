# Contains:
- Pytroch MNIST tutorial: Thoroughly commented basic neural network for MNIST dataset for people to learn/reference off of.
- Pytorch convolutional tutorial: Another tutorial in further depth with Pytorch using the Kaggle Cats & Dogs neural network.
  - Uses image manipulation library for the Cat and Dog images rather than importing pre-processed images for data.
- Pytorch text classification.py: A file containing a RNN for text classification using the AG_NEWS dataset.
- Loading Test Dataset.py: A file that is meant to load in multiple csv files "train.csv" and "valid.csv" (Using Torchtext) to make datasets for the use of our RNN (to be created later).
