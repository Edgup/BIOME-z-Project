1,1,Beyond Mead: Symbolic Interaction between Humans and Felines,"Recent research on the cognitive abilities and emotional capacities of animals has fueled the animal rights movement and renewed debate over the differences between human and non-human animals. This debate has not been central to sociology, although George Herbert Mead drew a very hard line between humans and animals by asserting that the latter were not capable of symbolic interaction. Sociologists are now beginning to question this assumption, and this article falls within this new line of research. We begin by presenting alternative interpretations of symbolic interaction that allow for the possibility of such activity in non-human animals. We review recent research on symbolic interaction between humans and dogs, and we present our own research findings on human-feline interaction. We conclude that there is growing evidence that symbolic interaction is widely distributed throughout the animal kingdom, and that it enables animals to survive more effectively in a wide variety of environments."
2,0,CARDIO-ESOPHAGEAL RELAXATION,"In our studies of the gastro-intestinal tract during the last three years, we have noticed under the fluoroscope a reflux of the barium meal from the stomach into the esophagus. As a result of this observation we have attempted to investigate this type of case with particular reference to its possible etiology and symptomatology. At first it was observed fluoroscopically only, with the patient in the prone position. In studying our old plates we have found some with the lower portion of the esophageal wall outlined with barium. Presumably we have missed or paid no attention to it heretofore. But since our attention has been called to it, we have found this condition in a larger percentage of cases, now 4.6 per cent, and have succeeded in demonstrating it on plates."
3,1,"Camera system for canines, felines, or other animal","A computer-aided training and management system that uses a computer or other processor in wireless communication with an instrumented dog collar and/or optionally, one or more dog interaction devices, such as, for example, video monitors, loudspeakers, video cameras, training toys (e.g., ball, bone, moving toy, etc.), an animatronics “trainer,” a treat dispenser, a food dispensing and monitoring device, a water dispensing and monitoring device, tracking devices, a dog door, dog-monitoring doghouse, a dog-monitoring dog toilet, is described. In one embodiment, the instrumented dog collar is in two-way communication with a central computer system."
4,0,Behind the mask: Eminem and postindustrial minstrelsy ,"Eminem has emerged in the last five years to become perhaps the pre-eminent hip-hop artist of his generation. Despite his success, he is a figure that has polarized audiences in the United States and elsewhere. While frequently criticized for promoting sentiments that are homophobic, misogynistic and violent, these impulses are presented in a way that is so exaggerated that they slip into and are indeed intended as parody. As such, Eminem provides an excellent example of the way in which rap artists utilize and engage with the traditions of signifying and the carnivalesque. This study argues that through his lyrics and stage costuming, Eminem is engaged in a form of racial burlesque that is a post-industrial updating of that performed by nineteenth-century blackface minstrels. In doing so, the article examines Eminem's relationship to constructions of authenticity within hip-hop culture, his coding as white trash, and his relationship to constructions of post-industrial white masculinity.
