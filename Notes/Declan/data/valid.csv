1,1,Interstitial Cystitis in Cats,Despite much research on FUS there still is no consensus regarding its cause or even its definition. We recently have demonstrated that some cases of FUS are similar to interstitial cystitis in human beings. Exclusion of anatomic defects behavior abnormalities neoplasia urolithiasis urethral obstruction and urinary tract infection leads one to the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis in cats. This diagnosis suggests the need for new approaches to treatment including pain management and environmental modification.
2,1,Environmental Enrichment for Indoor Cats,Recommendations to cat owners to house their cats indoors confer the responsibility to provide conditions that ensure good health and welfare. Cats maintain their natural behaviors such as scratching chewing and elimination while living indoors and they may develop health and behavior problems when deprived of appropriate environmental outlets for these behaviors. This article divides the environment into five basic “systems” to enable identification of features that may benefit from improvement. It also addresses practical means of meeting cats’ needs in each of these systems.
3,0,Acupuncture and endorphins,Acupuncture and electroacupuncture (EA) as complementary and alternative medicine have been accepted worldwide mainly for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Studies on the mechanisms of action have revealed that endogenous opioid peptides in the central nervous system play an essential role in mediating the analgesic effect of EA. Further studies have shown that different kinds of neuropeptides are released by EA with different frequencies. For example: EA of 2 Hz accelerates the release of enkephalin β-endorphin and endomorphin while that of 100 Hz selectively increases the release of dynorphin. A combination of the two frequencies produces a simultaneous release of all four opioid peptides resulting in a maximal therapeutic effect. This finding has been verified in clinical studies in patients with various kinds of chronic pain including low back pain and diabetic neuropathic pain.
4,0,Do Demand Curves for Stocks Slope Down?,Since September 1976 stocks newly included into the Standard and Poor's 500 Index have earned a significant positive abnormal return at the announcement of the inclusion. This return does not disappear for at least ten days after the inclusion. The returns are positively related to measures of buying by index funds consistent with the hypothesis that demand curves for stocks slope down. The returns are not related to S & P's bond ratings which is inconsistent with a plausible version of the hypothesis that inclusion is a certification of the quality of the stock.
