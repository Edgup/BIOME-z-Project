2,The phonological form of lexical items modulates the encoding of challenging second-language sound contrasts.,"The present study investigated whether the ability to encode the sounds of difficult second-language (L2) contrasts into novel nonnative lexical representations is modulated by the phonological form of the words to be learned. In 3 experiments, German learners of English were trained on word-picture associations with either novel minimal pairs only differing in the difficult /ε/-/æ/ contrast (Experiments 1 and 2; e.g., tendek-tandek) or pairs that additionally differed in their second syllables (Experiment 3; e.g., tenzer-tandek). Word recognition was assessed by means of a visual-world eye-tracking task. We asked whether learners would be more successful at encoding a distinction between the 2 vowels in the minimal-pair than in the nonminimal-pair items because of the central role of the contrast for accurate word learning with minimal pairs. Results from eye-fixation analyses at test showed that learners recognized /æ/-items faster than /ε/-items when they were minimal pairs and these pairs had already appeared together on the screen on a number of training trials (Experiment 1 vs. 2). This asymmetry could not be replicated with nonminimal pairs (Experiment 3). In line with previous studies, the asymmetry in Experiment 2 is taken as evidence of lexical separation for /ε/ and /æ/. Accordingly, we argue that exposure to the minimal-pair stimuli highlighted the challenging distinction by enhancing listeners’ attention to the critical sounds and conclude that the encoding of difficult L2 contrasts into the lexicon is more likely when the phonological form of the words emphasizes relevant phonological differences that may otherwise remain unnoticed.

3,Measuring mental health following traumatization: Psychometric analysis of the Kuwait Raha Scale using a random national household data set.,"The authors report on the psychometric properties of the Kuwait Raha Scale (KRS), a measure developed to assess well-being among Kuwaitis. Specific aims of the study were to (a) evaluate competing models of the latent structure of the KRS using exploratory factor analysis and identify the best model, (b) compare the model developed from a nationally representative sample with the initial model reported with Kuwaiti undergraduate students, and (c) assess the discriminant validity of the KRS with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Factor analysis suggested that a 5-factor model best suited the data, whereas the development of the KRS indicated a 4-factor model. Differences in the latent structure found between the current study and the original examination of the KRS factor structure may be attributed to the demographics of the samples used in the 2 studies. Whereas the earlier study used a sample of undergraduate college students, the current study acquired a nationally representative sample of the Kuwaiti population. Discriminant validity of the KRS with the GHQ indicated that the KRS and the GHQ measure different dimensions of health. Implications for theory and research are discussed, with particular attention to overcoming the challenges confronting the meaning and measurement of well-being in developing countries and stimulating interdisciplinary research.

3,Motherhood and associative moral stigma: The moral double bind.,"Past research shows that mothers of children with disabilities are a highly stigmatized group. In particular, they experience blame and shame through their connection to a stigmatized child. Mothers’ associative stigma is therefore distinctly moral in nature. Through in-depth interviews with parents of children with physical and cognitive disabilities (N = 36) we identify 2 realms of maternal moral vulnerability: child rearing and gestation. The former represents parenting practices of value transmission, social development, discipline, and behavioral control. The latter represents a physiological connection between mother and child. The distinction between rearing and gestation, and the ways that they intersect, provide conceptual clarity for the multiple and complex ways that stigma manifests for mothers of children with disabilities, and the strategies available to manage this stigma. We conclude that associative stigma is morally fraught for mothers of children with disabilities, creating a moral double bind in which mothers are culturally culpable in both behavior and body.

1,Exercise During Pregnancy and Type of Delivery in Nulliparae,"Objective: To assess the association between participation in aerobic exercise during the first two trimesters of pregnancy and type of delivery in nulliparous women. Design: Nonexperimental, retrospective. Setting: A large metropolitan area in the Participants: 137 nulliparous women. Outcome Measures: Method of delivery. Results: An unadjusted odds ratio showed that sedentary women (n=93) were 2.05 times more likely to deliver via cesarean section than active women (n= 44), but this relationship was not statistically significant. Through logistic regression analysis with control for the mother's prepregnancy exercise program, age, use of epidural anesthesia, change in prepregnancy to delivery body mass index, labor length, whether labor was induced, and the hospital of birth, the odds of cesarean delivery were found to be 4.5 times greater for sedentary women than for active women. Conclusion: Regular participation in physical activity during the first two trimesters of pregnancy may be associated with reduced risk for cesarean delivery in nulliparous women."
2,Children’s self-blame appraisals about their mothers’ depressive symptoms and risk for internalizing symptoms.,"Maternal depressive symptoms are a robust predictor of children’s risk for internalizing symptoms, yet not all children are negatively affected by exposure to their mothers’ symptoms. The present study tested children’s self-blame appraisals as a moderator of the association between maternal depressive symptoms and children’s internalizing symptoms, controlling for children’s negative attributional style. We hypothesized that the relation between maternal depressive symptoms and children’s internalizing symptoms would be stronger for children who blamed themselves more for their mothers’ symptoms. Participants were 129 mother–child dyads (M child age = 13.63, SD = 2.2; 52.7% female; 38.8% White, 31% African American, 22.5% Latinx/Hispanic) recruited from the community. Results indicated that maternal depressive symptoms were associated with higher levels of children’s internalizing symptoms for children who reported higher, but not lower, levels of self-blame appraisals. Results were consistent using mothers’ or children’s reports of their own and each other’s symptoms. The findings highlight the importance of assessing children’s appraisals about their mothers’ depressive symptoms, and suggest that preventive interventions should target children who endorse higher levels of self-blame appraisals. Furthermore, children’s self-blame appraisals about mothers’ depressive symptoms should be considered as a target of treatment for child internalizing disorders.

3,Environment dominates over host genetics in shaping human gut microbiota,"Human gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple factors but the relative contribution of host genetics remains elusive. Here we examine genotype and microbiome data from 1,046 healthy individuals with several distinct ancestral origins who share a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that the gut microbiome is not significantly associated with genetic ancestry, and that host genetics have a minor role in determining microbiome composition. We show that, by contrast, there are significant similarities in the compositions of the microbiomes of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household, and that over 20% of the inter-person microbiome variability is associated with factors related to diet, drugs and anthropometric measurements. We further demonstrate that microbiome data significantly improve the prediction accuracy for many human traits, such as glucose and obesity measures, compared to models that use only host genetic and environmental data. These results suggest that microbiome alterations aimed at improving clinical outcomes may be carried out across diverse genetic backgrounds."
3,"From defiance to reliance: Spiritual virtue as a pathway towards desistence, humility, and recovery among juvenile offenders.","This study examined the impact of two “spiritual virtues”—service to others and the spiritual experience of love—on sobriety, character development (humility), and recidivism. We control for conduct disorder and other comorbid conditions, including defiant behaviors. One hundred ninety-five adolescents with substance dependency court-referred to residential treatment were assessed at intake, discharge, and 12 months posttreatment. Higher service to others predicted reduced relapse and greater humility, with or without the experience of spiritual love. Defiance was associated with higher incarceration, but the combination of service and love predicted lower incarceration and mediated the impact of defiance. Survival analysis demonstrated that youths with low service, with or without high love, were more likely to relapse than high helpers with high love. Spiritual virtue appears to be a promising pathway for recovery and desistence, even for youthful offenders deemed the most difficult to rehabilitate.

2,The contribution of the gut microbiome to neurodevelopment and neuropsychiatric disorders,"Bidirectional communication between the gut and brain is well recognized, with data now accruing for a specific role of the gut microbiota in that link, referred to as the microbiome-gut-brain axis. This review will discuss the emerging role of the gut microbiota in brain development and behavior. Animal studies have clearly demonstrated effects of the gut microbiota on gene expression and neurochemical metabolism impacting behavior and performance. Based on these changes, a modulating role of the gut microbiota has been demonstrated for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and movement including Parkinson's, and importantly for the pediatric population autism. Critical developmental windows that influence early behavioral outcomes have been identified that include both the prenatal environment and early postnatal colonization periods. The clearest data regarding the role of the gut microbiota on neurodevelopment and psychiatric disorders is from animal studies; however, human data have begun to emerge, including an association between early colonization patterns and cognition. The importance of understanding the contribution of the gut microbiota to the development and functioning of the nervous system lies in the potential to intervene using novel microbial-based approaches to treating neurologic conditions. While pathways of communication between the gut and brain are well established, the gut microbiome is a new component of this axis. The way in which organisms that live in the gut influence the central nervous system (CNS) and host behavior is likely to be multifactorial in origin. This includes immunologic, endocrine, and metabolic mechanisms, all of which are pathways used for other microbial-host interactions. Germ-free (GF) mice are an important model system for understanding the impact of gut microbes on development and function of the nervous system. Alternative animal model systems have further clarified the role of the gut microbiota, including antibiotic treatment, fecal transplantation, and selective gut colonization with specific microbial organisms. Recently, researchers have started to examine the human host as well. This review will examine the components of the CNS potentially influenced by the gut microbiota, and the mechanisms mediating these effects. Links between gut microbial colonization patterns and host behavior relevant to a pediatric population will be examined, highlighting important developmental windows in utero or early in development."
3,Combating unmeasured confounding in cross-sectional studies: Evaluating instrumental-variable and Heckman selection models.,"Unmeasured confounding is the principal threat to unbiased estimation of treatment “effects” (i.e., regression parameters for binary regressors) in nonexperimental research. It refers to unmeasured characteristics of individuals that lead them both to be in a particular “treatment” category and to register higher or lower values than others on a response variable. In this article, I introduce readers to 2 econometric techniques designed to control the problem, with a particular emphasis on the Heckman selection model (HSM). Both techniques can be used with only cross-sectional data. Using a Monte Carlo experiment, I compare the performance of instrumental-variable regression (IVR) and HSM to that of ordinary least squares (OLS) under conditions with treatment and unmeasured confounding both present and absent. I find HSM generally to outperform IVR with respect to mean-square-error of treatment estimates, as well as power for detecting either a treatment effect or unobserved confounding. However, both HSM and IVR require a large sample to be fully effective. The use of HSM and IVR in tandem with OLS to untangle unobserved confounding bias in cross-sectional data is further demonstrated with an empirical application. Using data from the 2006–2010 General Social Survey (National Opinion Research Center, 2014), I examine the association between being married and subjective well-being.

3,From individual to community: The “framing” of 4-16 and the display of social solidarity.,"On April 16, 2007, a lone gunman killed 32 people at Virginia Tech. In this essay, we discuss what we personally experienced on 4-16 and what we did as faculty members of the sociology department in the first few weeks after 4-16. We place these events in the context of framing theory and the social construction of reality. We then offer insights regarding the surge in community spirit we witnessed immediately after the event. We discuss the well-documented relationship between tragedies and social solidarity. Although the surge in solidarity witnessed at Virginia Tech after the shootings often occurs after tragedies, we argue that social solidarity does not automatically follow tragedy. Instead, the tragedy must meet at least four specific conditions that allow individual interpretations of the event to blend with collective interpretations in a manner that produces a synergistic effect.

3,How resilient a refugee community could be: The Vietnamese of New Orleans.,"The Vietnamese community in New Orleans has experienced various challenges ranging from poverty to disasters and from refuge trauma experience to children’s education. Nonetheless, the community has remained strong, which has been manifested in its response after Hurricane Katrina and the BP oil spill. This article adopts the historical trauma framework to better understand the resilience of this ethnic community. The Vietnamese community in New Orleans had been studied by scholars in the field of sociology, ethnic studies, geography, health and mental health, to name the major ones. This author selected 42 publications by searching major databases of social sciences and public health (PubMed). Publications were then reviewed and analyzed according to such themes as shared group experience of trauma, intergenerational transmission of trauma, and community capacity and resilience. The Vietnamese refugee community in New Orleans suffers from collective trauma experience of war and repeated disasters. Although second-generation of Vietnamese refugees did show certain behavior and identity challenges during growing up, children’s behavior issues are not manifested or perceived as intergenerational transmission of trauma. Native language, cultural norms and practice, religious belief, collective mindset of self-sufficiency, and strong networks are often cited as unique community resilience characteristics. The Vietnamese community’s resilience is derived from the history of refuge and resettlement. A model that incorporates both community resilience and historical trauma framework is proposed to help better understand the community dynamics and the impact of community resilience on individuals and families.

3,Research note on whether sexual minority individuals are over-represented among suicide's casualties.,"Background: Past studies have repeatedly shown higher suicidal thoughts and attempts among sexual minority members, yet have remained opaque on whether these groups are more prone to taking their own lives. Aims: This short report focuses on suicide deaths among sexual minority members. Method: We utilized two large-scale surveys: one, among adults, the updated Cumulative General Social Surveys, and the other, among adolescents, The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), where respondents' data were cross-linked to National Death Index death records. Results: Results confirmed pre-existent findings showing elevated suicide rates among sexual minority females but not among sexual minority males. Limitations: The shortfall of female adolescent suicides in the Add Health sample prevented us from examining the question of female sexual minority suicides within this population. Conclusion: Although ample evidence demonstrates higher suicidal thoughts and attempts among sexual minority males, three studies presently do not confirm their greater propensity to die by suicide, compared with heterosexual males; yet, for sexual minority females the evidence is steadily mounting showing their greater suicide risks.

2,What can the gut microbiome teach us about the connections between child physical and mental health? A systematic review,"A deeper understanding of the gut-brain axis is of significance in pediatrics, given the influential role of early childhood experiences and exposures in shaping the microbiome, and health, across the life course. This systematic review synthesized evidence on the connection between the gut microbiome and mental health in children with physical illness. Six electronic databases were systematically searched and data extracted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Of 1,476 identified articles, 11 articles reporting on nine unique studies (all randomized controlled trials) were included. Most studies examined the gut microbiome in infants with colic, while the remaining studies investigated outcomes in children aged 1 day to 18 years at risk for atopic dermatitis or irritable bowel syndrome. Baseline and postintervention gut microbiome differences varied across studies. Findings on psychological functioning also varied, with only half of the captured studies showing a positive effect of intervention on psychological well-being. Only two studies analyzed the association between the gut microbiome and psychological outcomes, each with a different pattern of results. As the field moves forward, it will be critical to gain a better understanding of the microbiome characteristics that influence mental health outcomes in pediatric populations."
2,From regulation to refinement of emotions: Indigenization of Emotion Regulation Questionnaire in Taiwan.,"As an alternative to standardization, via back translation, of a foreign measure, researchers in Taiwan indigenized, via theory-driven modifications, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross & John, 2003) when they investigated the emotion regulation strategies in parent–child conflicts among Taiwanese teenagers and young adults. In this article, we make item-by-item comparison between two Chinese versions of ERQ—modified (Yeh, Bedford, Wu, Wang, & Yen, 2017) versus standardized (Li & Wu, 2018)—to reveal the conceptual and structural modifications involved in indigenization. We also examine the results of two studies—that used the modified version of ERQ to investigate the emotion regulation strategies of Taiwanese youth in parent–child conflicts—to explore the new capacities an indigenized measure may acquire through modification of the original instrument. Lastly, we discuss potential contributions of indigenization to psychology of emotion, and the advantages of indigenization over standardization of foreign measures.

2,The influence of orthography on speech production: Evidence from masked priming in word-naming and picture-naming tasks.,"In a masked priming word-naming task, a facilitation due to the initial-segmental sound overlap for 2-character kanji prime–target pairs was affected by certain orthographic properties (Yoshihara, Nakayama, Verdonschot, & Hino, 2017). That is, the facilitation that was due to the initial mora overlap occurred only when the mora was the whole pronunciation of their initial kanji characters (i.e., match pairs; e.g., 化石 /ka-se.ki/–火力 /ka-rjo.ku/). When the shared initial mora was only a part of the kanji characters’ readings, however, there was no facilitation (i.e., mismatch pairs; e.g., 発案 /ha.tu-a.N/–博物 /ha.ku-bu.tu/). In the present study, we used a masked priming picture-naming task to investigate whether the previous results were relevant only when the orthography of targets is visually presented. In Experiment 1, the main findings of our word-naming task were fully replicated in a picture-naming task. In Experiments 2 and 3, the absence of facilitation for the mismatch pairs were confirmed with a new set of stimuli. On the other hand, a significant facilitation was observed for the match pairs that shared the 2 initial morae (in Experiment 4), which was again consistent with the results of our word-naming study. These results suggest that the orthographic properties constrain the phonological expression of masked priming for kanji words across 2 tasks that are likely to differ in how phonology is retrieved. Specifically, we propose that orthography of a word is activated online and constrains the phonological encoding processes in these tasks.

2,Children adopted by same-sex couples: Identity-related issues from preschool years to late adolescence.,"Little research has investigated the experience of same-sex adoption from children’s perspective. What does it feel like to be adopted by 2 dads or 2 moms? How do the challenges related to being adopted and the challenges related to growing up in a same-sex-parent family overlap in the identity construction of adoptees? This is the 1st European study giving voice to children adopted by same-sex couples focusing on their adoptive and family-related identities at four developmental stages: early childhood, middle childhood, preadolescence, and adolescence. In-depth interviews were conducted with a sample of 44 adoptees (36 males and 8 females; ages 3−18 years) and 62 adoptive parents (16 lesbian women and 46 gay men). Thematic analysis revealed that adoptees deal with unique developmental challenges connected to the intersection of both their adoptive and familial minority statuses. They often reported being confronted with heteronormative assumptions of family, which led them to question themselves regarding the way their family is perceived by others, to idealize the heteronuclear family form, and to increase their curiosity about their birth parents. Findings shed light on the evolution of adoptees’ questions, feelings, and experiences related to their unique family arrangement from early childhood through adolescence, suggesting a better integration of their adoptive and minority group statuses at progressively more advanced developmental stages. Analyses underline the importance of open family communication for facilitating the integration of such complex elements in adoptees’ emerging identity. Practice implications of the findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"

The deadliest school shooting in American history quickly attracted the media. As journalists from every major domestic and foreign media outlet reported on the events of April 16 and its aftermath, the world saw images of and read stories about fragile individuals, a shocked and grief-stricken student body, and a community united in its grief. Yet the media did more than simply tell the story of the tragedy: it gave opinions on its cause, pondered its consequences, offered advice for recovering from the event, and speculated on how to prevent such events in the future. But, was the story told the same way across the various outlets or did the media source influence the coverage? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,Effect of glyphosate on soil microbial activity and biomass,"Herbicides applied to soils potentially affect soil microbial activity. Quantity and frequency of glyphosate application have escalated with the advent of glyphosate-tolerant crops. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of increasing glyphosate application rate on soil microbial biomass and activity. The soil used was Weswood silt loam. The isopropylamine salt of glyphosate was added at rates of 47, 94, 140, and 234 µg ai g−1 soil based on an assumed 2-mm glyphosate–soil interaction depth. Glyphosate significantly stimulated soil microbial activity as measured by C and N mineralization but did not affect soil microbial biomass. Cumulative C mineralization, as well as mineralization rate, increased with increasing glyphosate rate. Strong linear relationships between mineralized C and N and the amount of C and N added as glyphosate (r \ 2 = 0.995, 0.996) and slopes approximating one indicated that glyphosate was the direct cause of the enhanced microbial activity. An increase in C mineralization rate occurred the first day following glyphosate addition and continued for 14 d. Glyphosate appeared to be directly and rapidly degraded by microbes, even at high application rates, without adversely affecting microbial activity."

2,Protestant and Buddhist differences in noninfluence strategies of emotion regulation and their links to depressive symptoms.,"The present research proposes that Buddhist teachings involve a noninfluence emotion regulation strategy, an emotion regulation strategy that consists of individuals not influencing their emotions in any way, more so than do Protestant teachings. We examined religious teachings surrounding the strategy, practitioners’ use of the strategy, and its links with depression. Further, the nature of this noninfluence strategy was explored. Across 3 studies that used student, community, and online samples, results showed that in fact Buddhist practitioners were more likely than were Protestant practitioners to report that their religion teaches them to use noninfluence strategies of emotion regulation, and that they use noninfluence strategies of emotion regulation. Moreover, the use of noninfluence emotion regulation strategies was predictive of lower depressive symptoms across both religions (Studies 1 and 2). In addition, it was found that to practitioners, noninfluence strategies of emotion regulation are active, purposeful strategies and, especially to Buddhist practitioners, they involve acceptance of emotions (Study 2). Furthermore, religion was indirectly linked to the behavioral preference for a noninfluence strategy through the self-reported general use of a noninfluence emotion regulation strategy (Study 3). Implications for research on religion, self-regulation, and mental health are briefly discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,Evolutionary dynamics of bacteria in the gut microbiome within and across hosts,"Gut microbiota are shaped by a combination of ecological and evolutionary forces. While the ecological dynamics have been extensively studied, much less is known about how species of gut bacteria evolve over time. Here, we introduce a model-based framework for quantifying evolutionary dynamics within and across hosts using a panel of metagenomic samples. We use this approach to study evolution in approximately 40 prevalent species in the human gut. Although the patterns of between-host diversity are consistent with quasi-sexual evolution and purifying selection on long timescales, we identify new genealogical signatures that challenge standard population genetic models of these processes. Within hosts, we find that genetic differences that accumulate over 6-month timescales are only rarely attributable to replacement by distantly related strains. Instead, the resident strains more commonly acquire a smaller number of putative evolutionary changes, in which nucleotide variants or gene gains or losses rapidly sweep to high frequency. By comparing these mutations with the typical between-host differences, we find evidence that some sweeps may be seeded by recombination, in addition to new mutations. However, comparisons of adult twins suggest that replacement eventually overwhelms evolution over multi-decade timescales, hinting at fundamental limits to the extent of local adaptation. Together, our results suggest that gut bacteria can evolve on human-relevant timescales, and they highlight the connections between these short-term evolutionary dynamics and longer-term evolution across hosts.;"
3,Suicide and changing values and beliefs in Ireland.,"This paper addresses some of the generalized theories explaining rising suicide rates in Ireland. The conclusion here is that linking suicide patterns to changing beliefs and values is problematic. Church attendance as well as adherence to traditional values remain high in this country compared to European levels, and variations in beliefs and values, especially rural/urban differences, do not fit with general explanations. Moreover, attitudes to value areas fluctuate in that justification for suicide - which showed an upward trend in the 1980s - was reversed in the 1990s, and this may have resulted from increased public focus and debate. Generalized explanations are unlikely to decipher complex phenomena such as suicidal behavior. Religious belief, if protective in relation to suicide, is unlikely to act alone. Social transformations have a differential impact depending on one's socio-economic positioning, which translates ideas of a general male vulnerability to suicide into focused areas of male distress.

2,Feeling bad is not always unhealthy: Culture moderates the link between negative affect and diurnal cortisol profiles.,"Prior research has demonstrated that the daily experience of negative affect is associated with increased levels of proinflammatory activity as evidenced by higher interleukin-6 among Americans but not among Japanese. This cultural difference may be driven by culturally divergent beliefs about negative affect as a source of threat to self-image versus as natural and integral to life. Here, we examined whether culture may moderate the relationship between negative affect and biological stress responses, with a focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. By using culturally matched surveys of Americans (N = 761) and Japanese (N = 328), we found that negative affect was associated with a flattening of the diurnal cortisol slope among Americans after controlling for demographic variables, personality traits, sleep patterns, and health behaviors. In contrast, the association between negative affect and the HPA axis activity was negligible among Japanese. Moreover, we assessed biological health risk with biomarkers of both inflammation (interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels) and cardiovascular function (higher systolic blood pressure and total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio) and found that the relationship between negative affect and increased biological health risk, which was observed only among Americans, was mediated by the flattening of the diurnal cortisol rhythm. These findings suggest that cultural differences in how emotions are construed may make the experience of negative affect more or less stressful and differentially consequential for health.

2,Is adolescence the missing developmental link in Microbiome-Gut-Brain axis communication?,"Gut microbial research has recently opened new frontiers in neuroscience and potentiated novel therapies for mental health problems (Mayer, et al., 2014). Much of our understanding of the gut microbiome's role in brain function and behavior, however, has been largely derived from research on nonhuman animals. Even less is known about how the development of the gut microbiome influences critical periods of neural and behavioral development, particularly adolescence. In this review, we first discuss why the gut microbiome has become increasingly relevant to developmental cognitive neuroscience and provide a synopsis of the known connections of the gut microbiome with social-affective brain function and behavior, specifically highlighting human developmental work when possible. We then focus on adolescence, a key period of neurobiological and social-affective development. Specifically, we review the links between the gut microbiome and six overarching domains of change during adolescence: (a) social processes, (b) motivation and behavior, (c) neural development, (d) cognition, (e) neuroendocrine function, and (f) physical health and wellness. Using a developmental science perspective, we summarize key changes across these six domains to underscore the promise for the gut microbiome to bidirectionally influence and transform adolescent development."
3,Does social belonging to primary groups protect young people from the effects of pro-suicide sites? A comparative study of four countries.,"Background: The Internet has facilitated the existence of extreme and pathological communities that share information about ways to complete suicide or to deliberately harm or hurt oneself. This material is user-generated and easily accessible. Aims: The present study analyzed the buffering effect of social belonging to a primary group in the situation of pro-suicide site exposure. Method: Cross-national data were collected from the US, UK, Germany, and Finland in spring 2013 and 2014 from respondents aged 15–30 years (N = 3,567). Data were analyzed by using linear regression separately for women and men for each country. Results: A higher level of belonging to a primary group buffered the negative association of pro-suicide site exposure with mental health, measured as happiness, although the results were not consistent in the subgroups. US male subjects showed a significant buffering effect of the sense of belonging to family while the belonging to friends had a buffering effect among four other subgroups: British female and male subjects and Finnish female and male subjects. Conclusion: The results underline the positive potential of primary groups to shield young people’s mental health in the situation of pro-suicide site exposure.

3,Self-directed care: Participants’ service utilization and outcomes.,"Objective: Self-directed care (SDC) is a mental health service delivery model in which participants budget the state dollars allotted for their care to purchase the goods and services they deem most appropriate for achieving their recovery goals. This study examines the demographic characteristics, service utilization patterns, and outcomes of individuals enrolled in the Florida Self-Directed Care (FloridaSDC) program, which is the oldest and most established SDC program in the United States for individuals diagnosed with a severe and persistent mental illness. Method: This is a naturalistic descriptive study in which demographic, service utilization, and outcome data (i.e., Functional Assessment Rating Scale (FARS) scores, days in the community, days worked, monthly income, discharge status) were collected from the clinical and fiscal records of 136 FloridaSDC participants. Results: Key findings suggest that FloridaSDC participants had very little income and largely utilized their budgets to subsidize their living expenses. Though most participants did not work or earn income and very few left the program due to employment, participants’ FARS scores improved modestly and nearly all participants remained in the community throughout the study period. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Participants’ service purchases were rational given the poverty in which they live, and their outcomes did not suffer when they controlled decisions regarding their service needs. These findings highlight the utility and value of the personalized budgeting and individualized planning components of SDC. Findings also point to the need for practitioners to implement innovative strategies to enhance participants’ employment readiness and supported employment opportunities.

2,Does intelligence strengthen creative metacognition?,"Creative metacognition (CMC) is an understudied component of creative growth. It refers to people’s ability to monitor and evaluate their creative functioning. In this study we focus on an important element of CMC, creative metacognitive accuracy: people’s ability to recognize and properly assess the creativity of their ideas when solving divergent thinking tasks. More specifically, we explored how creative ability and intelligence interact to explain people’s self-ratings of their newly generated ideas’ creativity. A large sample of adults (n = 500) completed 3 divergent thinking tasks and immediately after provided general ratings of their responses’ creativity. External judges independently rated creativity of all generated responses. Expert-rated creativity was positively linked to participants’ creativity self-ratings, yet negatively related to participants’ intelligence. More important, creativity and intelligence interacted with each other: self-ratings of creativity corresponded with experts’ assessment among more intelligent people, whereas people with lower intelligence overestimated the creativity of their ideas, especially when these ideas were less creative. Thus, a clear effect of metacognitive accuracy was observed among participants with higher intelligence. We discuss the results in the light of potential mechanisms that analytical and creative skills may play for CMC. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,The microbiome in patients with atopic dermatitis,"As an interface with the environment, the skin is a complex ecosystem colonized by many microorganisms that coexist in an established balance. The cutaneous microbiome inhibits colonization with pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, and is a crucial component for function of the epidermal barrier. Moreover, crosstalk between commensals and the immune system is now recognized because microorganisms can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. Host-commensal interactions also have an effect on the developing immune system in infants and, subsequently, the occurrence of diseases, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD). Later in life, the cutaneous microbiome contributes to the development and course of skin disease. Accordingly, in patients with AD, a decrease in microbiome diversity correlates with disease severity and increased colonization with pathogenic bacteria, such as S aureus. Early clinical studies suggest that topical application of commensal organisms (eg, Staphylococcus hominis or Roseomonas mucosa) reduces AD severity, which supports an important role for commensals in decreasing S aureus colonization in patients with AD. Advancing knowledge of the cutaneous microbiome and its function in modulating the course of skin disorders, such as AD, might result in novel therapeutic strategies."
1,The Microbiome of an Active Meat Curing Brine,"Traditional food products are important to our culture and heritage, and to the continued success of the food industry. Many of the production processes associated with these products have not been subjected to an in-depth microbial compositional analysis. The traditional process of curing meat, both preserves a natural protein source, as well as increasing its organoleptic qualities. One of the most important salting processes is known as Wiltshire curing. The Wiltshire process involves injecting pork with a curing solution and immersing the meat into microbial-rich brine which promotes the development of the distinct organoleptic characteristics. The important microbial component of Wiltshire brine has not been extensively characterized. We analyzed the key microbial component of Wiltshire brine by performing microbiome analysis using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. This analysis identified the genera, Marinilactibacillus, Carnobacterium, Leuconostoc and Vibrio as the core microflora present in Wiltshire curing brine. The important food industrial applications of these bacteria were also assessed. The bacterial diversity of the brine was investigated, and the community composition of the brine was demonstrated to change over time. New knowledge on the characterization of key microbiota associated with a productive Wiltshire brine is an important development linked to promoting enhanced quality and safety of meat processing in the food industry."
2,"Bugs are blech, butterflies are beautiful, but both are bad to bite: Admired animals are disgusting to eat but are themselves neither disgusting nor contaminating.","It is often assumed that things that are disgusting to eat are, themselves, disgusting, and that things that are disgusting to eat are also contaminating. We present data that counters both of these assumptions. In adult American and Indian samples, Study 1 provides evidence that, in contrast to many other insects, participants have positive attitudes toward butterflies. Participants are relatively unbothered by touching them or eating food that they have contacted but are very disgusted by the thought of eating them. Study 2 extends these findings with an adult American sample, comparing four pairs of animals, one admired and one disgusting: butterflies and cockroaches, canaries and vultures, koalas and rats, and dogs and hyenas. In all 4 cases, the positive animals themselves are rated as very low in disgustingness but rated as very disgusting to consume—almost as disgusting as the negative animals. However, although contact between the negative animals and a favorite food produces a strong disgust response to the favorite food, this contamination effect is much smaller, and sometimes absent, with the positive animals. We present evidence that the perceived immorality of killing admired animals is related to the disgust at consuming them. Disgust at eating an admired animal may have a moral component because it involves, at least indirectly, killing the animal. An admired animal that has contacted a favored food does not reliably make that food disgusting. In this scenario, as opposed to eating, there is no harm to the animal.

2,Man and the Microbiome: A New Theory of Everything?,"The gut microbiome is implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide range of psychological disorders. Preclinical studies have provided us with key insights into the mechanisms by which the microbiome influences bidirectional gut–brain communication. There are many signaling pathways involved, including the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, immune modulation, tryptophan and serotonin metabolism, bile acid transformation, microbial production of neuroactive compounds, and regulation of the endocannabinoid system. The complex and widespread influence of the microbiome on many physiological and psychological processes has generated a keen interest in its therapeutic potential for depression, anxiety, autism, and other psychiatric disorders. It has been shown that the microbiome composition of people suffering with such conditions differs significantly from that of healthy controls, and although the area is in its infancy, interventional studies that alter a person's microbiome through the use of probiotics, prebiotics, or dietary change can alleviate psychopathological symptoms. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Clinical Psychology Volume 15 is May 7, 2019. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates."
2,Joint attention partially mediates the longitudinal relation between attuned caregiving and executive functions for low-income children.,"Using data from a large longitudinal sample (N = 1,292) of children and their caregivers in predominantly low-income, nonurban communities, we investigated longitudinal relations between attuned caregiving in infancy, joint attention in toddlerhood, and executive functions in early childhood. The results from path analysis demonstrated that attuned caregiving during infancy predicted more joint attention in toddlerhood, which was in turn associated with better executive function performance in early childhood. Joint attention was a stronger predictor of executive functions for lower-income families. Moreover, joint attention mediated the relation between attuned caregiving and executive functions, and this mediation was amplified for lower-income families. These results highlight joint attention as a key mechanism through which attuned caregiving supports the development of executive functions, particularly for low-income families.

2,Common variants of the oxytocin receptor gene do not predict the positive mood benefits of prosocial spending.,"Who benefits most from helping others? Previous research suggests that common polymorphisms of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) predict whether people behave generously and experience increases in positive mood in response to socially focused experiences in daily life. Building on these findings, we conducted an experiment with a large, ethnically homogenous sample (N = 437) to examine whether individual differences in three frequently studied single nucleotide polymorphisms of OXTR (rs53576, rs2268498, rs2254298) also predict differences in the positive mood benefits of financial generosity. Consistent with past research, participants who were randomly assigned to purchase items for others (vs. themselves) reported greater positive affect. Contrary to predictions, using Bayesian statistics, we found conclusive evidence that the benefits of generosity were not moderated by individual differences in OXTR single nucleotide polymorphisms. The current work highlights the importance of publishing null results to build cumulative knowledge linking neurobiological factors to positive emotional experiences.

2,Infant Gut Microbiome Associated With Cognitive Development,"Background \ Studies in rodents provide compelling evidence that microorganisms inhabiting the gut influence neurodevelopment. In particular, experimental manipulations that alter intestinal microbiota impact exploratory and communicative behaviors and cognitive performance. In humans, the first years of life are a dynamic time in gut colonization and brain development, but little is known about the relationship between these two processes. \ Methods \ We tested whether microbial composition at 1 year of age is associated with cognitive outcomes using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and with global and regional brain volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging at 1 and 2 years of age. Fecal samples were collected from 89 typically developing 1-year-olds. 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing was used for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa. \ Results \ Cluster analysis identified 3 groups of infants defined by their bacterial composition. Mullen scores at 2 years of age differed significantly between clusters. In addition, higher alpha diversity was associated with lower scores on the overall composite score, visual reception scale, and expressive language scale at 2 years of age. Exploratory analyses of neuroimaging data suggest the gut microbiome has minimal effects on regional brain volumes at 1 and 2 years of age. \ Conclusions \ This is the first study to demonstrate associations between the gut microbiota and cognition in human infants. As such, it represents an essential first step in translating animal data into the clinic."
1,A Critical Review of the Bacterial Baptism Hypothesis and the Impact of Cesarean Delivery on the Infant Microbiome,"Numerous studies suggest that infants delivered by cesarean section are at a greater risk of non-communicable diseases than their vaginal counterparts. In particular, epidemiological studies have linked Cesarean delivery with increased rates of asthma, allergies, autoimmune disorders, and obesity. Mode of delivery has also been associated with differences in the infant microbiome. It has been suggested that these differences are attributable to the “bacterial baptism” of vaginal birth, which is bypassed in cesarean deliveries, and that the abnormal establishment of the early-life microbiome is the mediator of later-life adverse outcomes observed in cesarean delivered infants. This has led to the increasingly popular practice of “vaginal seeding”: the iatrogenic transfer of vaginal microbiota to the neonate to promote establishment of a “normal” infant microbiome. In this review, we summarize and critically appraise the current evidence for a causal association between Cesarean delivery and neonatal dysbiosis. We suggest that, while Cesarean delivery is certainly associated with alterations in the infant microbiome, the lack of exposure to vaginal microbiota is unlikely to be a major contributing factor. Instead, it is likely that indication for Cesarean delivery, intrapartum antibiotic administration, absence of labor, differences in breastfeeding behaviors, maternal obesity, and gestational age are major drivers of the Cesarean delivery microbial phenotype. We, therefore, call into question the rationale for “vaginal seeding” and support calls for the halting of this practice until robust evidence of need, efficacy, and safety is available."
2,"Combinatorial effects of discrimination, legal status fears, adverse childhood experiences, and harsh working conditions among Latino migrant farmworkers: Testing learned helplessness hypotheses.","Migrant farmwork is often characterized by harsh working conditions that carry significant physical and mental health consequences. Using a learned helplessness framework, the current study examined the extent to which discrimination, immigration legal status difficulties, and adverse childhood experiences moderated the effects of harsh working conditions on depression and anxiety. The study also examined the extent to which harsh working conditions mediated the effects of discrimination, immigration legal status difficulties, and adverse childhood experiences on depression and anxiety. Participants were 241 migrant farmworkers recruited in the Midwest. Participants completed interviews consisting of the Migrant Farmworker Stress Index (MFWSI), Adverse Childhood Events Scale (ACEs), Everyday Discrimination Scale, the Centers for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Tests of indirect effects suggested, working conditions mediated the effects of ACEs, immigration legal status fears, and discrimination on CES-D and GAD-7 scores (p values p values p values > .05). Likely through different mechanisms, adverse childhood experiences, discrimination and immigration legal status are associated with higher risk of harsh working conditions and subsequently these conditions account for much of the relations between these 3 stressors with depression and anxiety. Additionally, discrimination and adverse childhood experiences appear to then enhance the effects of working conditions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,Effects of elevated carbon dioxide on environmental microbes and its mechanisms: A review,"Before the industrial revolution, the atmospheric CO2 concentration was 180–330 ppm; however, fossil-fuel combustion and forest destruction have led to increased atmospheric CO2 concentration. CO2 capture and storage is regarded as a promising strategy to prevent global warming and ocean acidification and to alleviate elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, but the leakage of CO2 from storage system can lead to rapid acidification of the surrounding circumstance, which might cause negative influence on environmental microbes. The effects of elevated CO2 on microbes have been reported extensively, but the review regarding CO2 affecting different environmental microorganisms has never been done previously. Also, the mechanisms of CO2 affecting environmental microorganisms are usually contributed to the change of pH values, while the direct influences of CO2 on microorganisms were often neglected. This paper aimed to provide a systematic review of elevated CO2 affecting environmental microbes and its mechanisms. Firstly, the influences of elevated CO2 and potential leakage of CO2 from storage sites on community structures and diversity of different surrounding environmental microbes were assessed and compared. Secondly, the adverse impacts of CO2 on microbial growth, cell morphology and membranes, bacterial spores, and microbial metabolism were introduced. Then, based on biochemical principles and knowledge of microbiology and molecular biology, the fundamental mechanisms of the influences of carbon dioxide on environmental microbes were discussed from the aspects of enzyme activity, electron generation and transfer, and key gene and protein expressions. Finally, key questions relevant to the environmental effect of CO2 that need to be answered in the future were addressed."
3,Patient care complexity as perceived by primary care physicians.,"Introduction: Currently there are various definitions of patient care complexity with little consensus. The numbers of patients with complex care needs are increasing. To improve interventions for “complex patients” and appropriately reimburse healthcare providers it is important to determine the characteristics or contextual factors contributing to complexity. Method: Action research methods were used to enhance an explicit understanding of complexity. Several conferences were organized and primary care physicians, nurses, social science faculty, and patients shared their perspectives on patient care complexity. A subset of attendees created a complex patient screening tool, which was piloted by 12 primary care physicians with 267 patients to identify which factors contribute to complexity. Results: Complex patients were found to differ significantly from noncomplex patients based on factors associated with complexity. Based on latent class analysis, 58% of complex patients were characterized by multiple diagnoses, mental health issues, and a lack of effective participation in their care plans, while 42% of patients were considered complex because of multiple diagnoses only. In contrast, 90% of the noncomplex patients had no discernable pattern of health issues, while 10% of noncomplex patients had mental health and insurance issues that were easily managed. These results identify several factors that distinguish patients with complex care needs from those without complex care needs. The results also illustrate the heterogeneity within classes of patients identified as having complex care needs or non-complex needs. Discussion: By identifying factors contributing to complexity, this research has important implications for enhancing the management of patients with complex care needs.

3,Darker days? Recent trends in depression disparities among U.S. adults.,"Depression is the most prevalent mood disorder in the United States, and disparities in depressive symptoms and treatment by socioeconomic status have been well-documented. Recent evidence suggests the prevalence of depression is increasing, but less is known about time trends in disparities. Using nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we examined patterns of depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and treatment (self-reported psychotherapy and psychopharmacology). We assessed time trends in depression disparities by educational attainment among U.S. adults 2005–2014 using logistic regression models. Among the least educated groups, the odds of moderate to severe depressive symptoms increased; for the most educated, they remained stable (women) or decreased (men). At the same time, odds of receiving treatment, conditional on being depressed, declined (women) or remained stable (men) for the least educated group, whereas treatment rates stayed steady (women) or increased (men) for the most educated. Between 2005 and 2014, overall depression prevalence increased. Despite recent policies designed to improve mental health care coverage, depression treatment rates were unable to keep pace. The least educated consistently had the highest rates of moderate to severe depressive symptoms and the lowest rates of treatment. Disparities in depression by educational attainment have persisted or worsened. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"

3,Heightened susceptibility to secondary traumatization: A meta-analysis of gender differences.,"Although secondary traumatization has been extensively studied, gender difference in susceptibility has received limited attention. This study addressed the issue by a meta-analysis of published findings on male and female persons in close, extended relationships with trauma victims, namely, their spouses, parents, children, and therapists. The analysis included peer-reviewed studies, written in English and published between 1990 and January 2012. Twelve studies reporting 17 findings on 1,623 subjects were identified. All the studies showed females’ higher susceptibility to secondary traumatization, with a mean effect size of 0.48 (95% CI [0.35, 0.60]). Moderator analysis revealed that studies conducted in the United States reported lower gender discrepancies than studies conducted elsewhere. The consistent finding that females are considerably more susceptible to secondary traumatization than males means that professionals must be made aware of the special vulnerability of girls and women and help them adopt ways of caring for the traumatized family member or clients while maintaining their own psychological boundaries.

2,The gut microbiome in neurological disorders,"Research into the role of the gut microbiome in modulating brain function has rapidly increased over the past 10 years, albeit chiefly in animal models. Increasing clinical and preclinical evidence implicates the microbiome as a possible key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Cross-sectional clinical studies are bolstering the concept of altered microbial composition contributing to the pathophysiology of such diseases. However, the field is nascent, and interpretation of such data is often difficult given that the composition of the microbiome is influenced by various factors such as diet and exercise. Longitudinal studies and randomised controlled trials in humans are needed to find out if targeting the microbiome can yield novel therapeutic strategies. Systems biology approaches will also be important in integrating such data with genomic and metabolomic datasets from clinical cohorts with neurological disease to help guide individual treatment selection."

1,Natural immunity: Biodiversity loss and inflammatory diseases are two global megatrends that might be related,"We are witnessing two global and deeply worrying trends that, at first glance, seem unrelated. The first trend is the ongoing decline in biodiversity, which is caused by human actions. It could well become the sixth mass extinction of animal and plant species on Earth, comparable in magnitude with the fifth mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago. The second trend is a rapid increase in chronic diseases that are associated with inflammation, especially in developed countries (Fig 1). Inflammation is a key attribute in asthma and allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases and many cancers; even depression has been associated with the presence of inflammatory markers. In this article, we argue that these two phenomena are more closely related than commonly thought: declining biodiversity might actually increase the risk to humanity from chronic diseases and thereby cause a major public health problem. \  \ > We thereby extend the hygiene and microbial deprivation hypotheses to a biodiversity hypothesis, with inevitable consequences for public health \  \  \  \ Figure 1.  \ Two global megatrends in biodiversity and public health.

1,Delivery mode shapes the acquisition and structure of the initial microbiota across multiple body habitats in newborns,"Upon delivery, the neonate is exposed for the first time to a wide array of microbes from a variety of sources, including maternal bacteria. Although prior studies have suggested that delivery mode shapes the microbiota's establishment and, subsequently, its role in child health, most researchers have focused on specific bacterial taxa or on a single body habitat, the gut. Thus, the initiation stage of human microbiome development remains obscure. The goal of the present study was to obtain a community-wide perspective on the influence of delivery mode and body habitat on the neonate's first microbiota. We used multiplexed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize bacterial communities from mothers and their newborn babies, four born vaginally and six born via Cesarean section. Mothers’ skin, oral mucosa, and vagina were sampled 1 h before delivery, and neonates’ skin, oral mucosa, and nasopharyngeal aspirate were sampled <5 min, and meconium <24 h, after delivery. We found that in direct contrast to the highly differentiated communities of their mothers, neonates harbored bacterial communities that were undifferentiated across multiple body habitats, regardless of delivery mode. Our results also show that vaginally delivered infants acquired bacterial communities resembling their own mother's vaginal microbiota, dominated by Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia spp., and C-section infants harbored bacterial communities similar to those found on the skin surface, dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium spp. These findings establish an important baseline for studies tracking the human microbiome's successional development in different body habitats following different delivery modes, and their associated effects on infant health."
3,Demanding attention: An exploration of institutional characteristics of recent student demands.,"The recent student movement activities across the nation marked a new era in student activism in higher education. Similar to past student movement eras, a powerful aspect of these activities was the issuance of demands to change various institutional policies, procedures, and infrastructure to promote diversity as well as equity and inclusion. Student demands were often concerned with changing issues that hampered the academic and social well-being of marginalized students. However, identifying how the student demands relate to patterns of systemic issues across institutions needs additional attention. Through a reorientation of a college impact approach to further center on student experiences, the current study promotes the consideration of students impacting their institutions, which challenges a traditional linear view of colleges affecting students with little possibility of a reciprocal relationship. Through an analysis of student demands across the nation, we find subtle patterns about where demands were issued and the context of these demands that gesture to how students readily identified what administrators need to do to support the educations of marginalized students. Further, when considering the institutionalized feature of Africana Studies that resulted from a student-led social movement of the past, our analyses suggest how students can shape their institutions for future generations and push to transform higher education into a more equitable, inclusive, and socially just educational environment.

2,Mother–adolescent emotion dynamics during conflicts: Associations with perspective taking.,"Parent–adolescent emotion dynamics are central to psychosocial adjustment during this developmental period. Perspective taking—the ability to take another’s point of view into consideration—develops significantly during adolescence and is important for successful interpersonal functioning in contexts such as conflicts between family members. We used grid-sequence analysis (Brinberg, Fosco, & Ram, 2017) to examine interdyad differences in mother–adolescent emotion dynamics during a conflict discussion, and whether interdyad differences were associated with maternal and adolescent perspective taking. Mothers and their typically developing adolescents (N = 49, Mage = 14.84 years) were video-recorded during a 10-min conflict discussion. We identified patterns of multistep chains of expressed emotions that unfolded during the conflict and how interdyad differences in those patterns were associated with maternal and adolescent perspective taking. Dyads differed with respect to whether they showed turn taking in validation and interest behaviors, or whether they showed patterns of reciprocated negative affect. Higher adolescent but not maternal perspective taking was associated with dyadic turn taking of validation and interest. Maternal and adolescent perspective taking were not associated with the pattern of reciprocated negative affect. Taken together, results highlight the importance of examining the complex process of emotion dynamics in parent–adolescent interactions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"

3,“Beasting” at the battleground: Black students responding to racial microaggressions in higher education.,"Black students are often tasked with negotiating racial microaggressions—subtle, racialized offenses—at historically White colleges and universities. Higher education scholarship has found that when Black students speak up in response to racial microaggressions, they tend to feel overburdened with having to educate the offending party. This article demonstrates how Black students used a more empowering strategy that they called beasting, where they utilized culturally affirming counternarratives to actively oppose racial microaggressions. In this process, Black students drew upon their own diverse knowledge base to contest and reframe dominant ideologies that stereotyped, dismissed, and devalued their racial group. These counternarratives included: (a) asserting Black intellect; (b) centering Black history, culture and perspectives; and (c) affirming the diversity within Black communities. These culturally affirming counternarratives serve as a powerful form of resistant capital for Black students. Moreover, the university context can facilitate the sharing of these narratives through Black student organizations, ethnic studies courses, and friendship networks. Black students can utilize this resistant capital in the future to navigate other historically White institutions that are critical to social mobility.

1,Investigation of the Skin Microbiome: Swabs vs Biopsies,"BACKGROUND: Human skin is populated by diverse bacteria and there is increasing evidence that resident bacteria play a key role initiating immune responses in cutaneous diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Bacteria are present at all layers of the skin but many studies have relied on swabs to profile the skin microbiota. As the pathogenesis of many skin conditions is dermal, we wished to compare the microbiota obtained in swabs (surface) and biopsies (dermis). Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing we established the microbial profiles of skin swabs and skin biopsies in sixteen subjects. We found differences in both diversity and taxonomic composition of the microbiome obtained from swabs and biopsies of the same individual. Several taxa were found to be more abundant in the swabs, which displayed significantly higher community richness, but Clostridiales and Bacteroidetes were significantly enriched in the biopsies. The majority of published research on cutaneous microbiota has been based on skin swabs, which represent the surface of the skin. Our study demonstrated a clear difference between the microbiome observed in skin swabs and skin biopsies. These findings may be highly relevant in disorders such as psoriasis where pathogenesis arises in the dermis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
3,Callers’ experiences of contacting a national suicide prevention helpline: Report of an online survey.,"Background: Helplines are a significant phenomenon in the mixed economy of health and social care. Given the often anonymous and fleeting nature of caller contact, it is difficult to obtain data about their impact and how users perceive their value. This paper reports findings from an online survey of callers contacting Samaritans emotional support services. Aims: To explore the (self-reported) characteristics of callers using a national suicide prevention helpline and their reasons given for contacting the service, and to present the users’ evaluations of the service they received. Methods: Online survey of a self-selected sample of callers. Results: 1,309 responses were received between May 2008 and May 2009. There were high incidences of expressed suicidality and mental health issues. Regular and ongoing use of the service was common. Respondents used the service for complex and varied reasons and often as part of a network of support. Conclusions: Respondents reported high levels of satisfaction with the service and perceived contact to be helpful. Although Samaritans aims to provide a crisis service, many callers do not access this in isolation or as a last resort, instead contacting the organization selectively and often in tandem with other types of support.

1,A broken promise: microbiome differential abundance methods do not control the false discovery rate,"High-throughput sequencing technologies allow easy characterization of the human microbiome, but the statistical methods to analyze microbiome data are still in their infancy. Differential abundance methods aim at detecting associations between the abundances of bacterial species and subject grouping factors. The results of such methods are important to identify the microbiome as a prognostic or diagnostic biomarker or to demonstrate efficacy of prodrug or antibiotic drugs. Because of a lack of benchmarking studies in the microbiome field, no consensus exists on the performance of the statistical methods. We have compared a large number of popular methods through extensive parametric and nonparametric simulation as well as real data shuffling algorithms. The results are consistent over the different approaches and all point to an alarming excess of false discoveries. This raises great doubts about the reliability of discoveries in past studies and imperils reproducibility of microbiome experiments. To further improve method benchmarking, we introduce a new simulation tool that allows to generate correlated count data following any univariate count distribution; the correlation structure may be inferred from real data. Most simulation studies discard the correlation between species, but our results indicate that this correlation can negatively affect the performance of statistical methods."
3,Fear of COVID-19 and the mental health consequences in America.,"The intent of this work was to examine the intersection of COVID-19 fear with social vulnerabilities and mental health consequences among adults living in the United States. Data are from a nationally representative sample (n = 10,368) of U.S. adults surveyed online during demographic subgroups (gender, age, income, race and ethnicity, geography). The sample week of March 23, 2020. The sample was poststratification weighted to ensure a balanced representation across social and demographic subgroups (gender, age, income, race or ethnicity, geography). The sample comprised 51% female; 23% non-White; 18% Hispanic; 25% of households with children under 18 years of age; 55% unmarried; and nearly 20% unemployed, laid off, or furloughed at the time of the interview. Respondents were fearful, averaging a score of nearly 7 on a scale of 10 when asked how fearful they were of COVID-19. Preliminary analysis suggests clear spatial diffusion of COVID-19 fear. Fear appears to be concentrated in regions with the highest reported COVID-19 cases. Significant differences across several U.S. census regions are noted (p < .01). Additionally, significant bivariate relationships were found between socially vulnerable respondents (female, Asians, Hispanic, foreign-born, families with children) and fear, as well as with mental health consequences (anxiety and depressive symptoms). Depressive symptoms, on average, were high (16+ on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), and more than 25% of the sample reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. More in-depth psychosocial research is needed using nationally representative samples that can help to inform potential mental health risks, as well as by targeting specific mental health interventions.

3,Review of Immigrant families in contemporary society.,"Reviews the book, Immigrant families in contemporary society edited by Jennifer E. Lansford, Kirby Deater-Deckard, and Marc H. Bornstein (see record 2007-11856-000). This book is a timely and useful addition to the literature on the health and development of immigrant children and families. As the fifth volume in the Duke Series in Child Development and Public Policy, its stated purpose is to synthesize cutting edge research and theory on child development in order to bring to bear public policy and other solutions to problems facing children and families in contemporary society. The volume results from the papers presented at a conference with nationally renowned scholars in the fields of sociology, social work, anthropology, public policy, medicine, economics, family studies, and others. This interdisciplinary approach makes this book a valuable reference for all of these disciplines, as well as other individuals who work with immigrants and refugees. While being thoughtful and well-researched, the language and style of the contributions will be accessible and understandable to readers from academia to front line practitioners.

1,Monocyte-Macrophage activation is associated with NAFLD and liver fibrosis in HIV mono-infection independently of the gut microbiome and bacterial translocation,"BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common among people living with HIV. There is limited data available on the pathophysiology of NAFLD and the development of fibrosis in this population. \ OBJECTIVES: to investigate the association of bacterial translocation, adipose tissue dysfunction, monocyte activation and gut dysbiosis in patients with HIV mono-infection and NAFLD. \ METHODS: Cases with biopsy-proven NAFLD and HIV mono-infection were age and sex-matched to HIV+ and HIV- controls. Markers of bacterial translocation (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), bacterial DNA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), adipose tissue dysfunction (leptin, adiponectin) and monocyte activation (sCD14 and sCD163) were measured by ELISA. Hepatic patterns of macrophage activation were explored with immunohistochemistry. 16 s rRNA sequencing was performed with stool. \ RESULTS: Thirty-three cases were included (≥F2 fibrosis n = 16), matched to HIV+ (n = 29) and HIV- (n = 17) controls. Cases with NAFLD were more obese (BMI 31.0 ± 4.4 kg/m vs 24.1 ± 2.8 kg/m p < 0.001) and had significantly increased levels of sCD14, sCD163 and higher leptin to adiponectin ratio versus HIV+ controls. Cases with ≥F2 verses < F2 fibrosis had increased sCD14 (1.4 ± 0.4 vs 1.1 ± 0.3 μg/ml, p = 0.023) and sCD163 (1.0 ± 0.3 vs 0.8 ± 0.3 μg/ml, p = 0.060) which correlated with waist circumference (sCD14 p = 0.022, sCD163 p = 0.011). Immunohistochemistry showed increased hepatic portal macrophage clusters in patients with fibrosis. No markers of bacterial translocation or changes to the microbiome were associated with NAFLD or fibrosis. \ CONCLUSION: NAFLD fibrosis stage in HIV mono-infected patients is associated with monocyte activation in the context of obesity, which may be independent of bacterial translocation and gut microbiome."

1,"Omadacycline Gut Microbiome Exposure Does Not Induce Clostridium difficile Proliferation or Toxin Production in a Model That Simulates the Proximal, Medial, and Distal Human Colon","A clinically reflective model of the human colon was used to investigate the effects of the broad-spectrum antibiotic omadacycline on the gut microbiome and the subsequent potential to induce simulated Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Triple-stage chemostat gut models were inoculated with pooled human fecal slurry from healthy volunteers (age, ≥60 years)., A clinically reflective model of the human colon was used to investigate the effects of the broad-spectrum antibiotic omadacycline on the gut microbiome and the subsequent potential to induce simulated Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Triple-stage chemostat gut models were inoculated with pooled human fecal slurry from healthy volunteers (age, ≥60 years). Models were challenged twice with 107 CFU C. difficile spores (PCR ribotype 027). Omadacycline effects were assessed in a single gut model. Observations were confirmed in a parallel study with omadacycline and moxifloxacin. Antibiotic instillation was performed once daily for 7 days. The models were observed for 3 weeks postantibiotic challenge. Gut microbiota populations and C. difficile total viable and spore counts were enumerated daily by culture. Cytotoxin titers and antibiotic concentrations were also measured. Gut microbiota populations were stable before antibiotic challenge. Moxifloxacin instillation caused an ∼4 log10 CFU/ml decline in enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis group populations and an ∼3 log10 CFU/ml decline in bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, followed by simulated CDI (vegetative cell proliferation and detectable toxin). In both models, omadacycline instillation decreased populations of bifidobacteria (∼8 log10 CFU/ml), B. fragilis group populations (7 to 8 log10 CFU/ml), lactobacilli (2 to 6 log10 CFU/ml), and enterococci (4 to 6 log10 CFU/ml). Despite these microbial shifts, there was no evidence of C. difficile bacteria germination or toxin production. In contrast to moxifloxacin, omadacycline exposure did not facilitate simulated CDI, suggesting this antibiotic may have a low propensity to induce CDI in the clinical setting."
3,The impact of human activities and lifestyles on the interlinked microbiota and health of humans and of ecosystems,"Plants, animals and humans, are colonized by microorganisms (microbiota) and transiently exposed to countless others. The microbiota affects the development and function of essentially all organ systems, and contributes to adaptation and evolution, while protecting against pathogenic microorganisms and toxins. Genetics and lifestyle factors, including diet, antibiotics and other drugs, and exposure to the natural environment, affect the composition of the microbiota, which influences host health through modulation of interrelated physiological systems. These include immune system development and regulation, metabolic and endocrine pathways, brain function and epigenetic modification of the genome. Importantly, parental microbiotas have transgenerational impacts on the health of progeny. Humans, animals and plants share similar relationships with microbes. Research paradigms from humans and other mammals, amphibians, insects, planktonic crustaceans and plants demonstrate the influence of environmental microbial ecosystems on the microbiota and health of organisms, and indicate links between environmental and internal microbial diversity and good health. Therefore, overlapping compositions, and interconnected roles of microbes in human, animal and plant health should be considered within the broader context of terrestrial and aquatic microbial ecosystems that are challenged by the human lifestyle and by agricultural and industrial activities. Here, we propose research priorities and organizational, educational and administrative measures that will help to identify safe microbe-associated health-promoting modalities and practices. In the spirit of an expanding version of “One health” that includes environmental health and its relation to human cultures and habits (EcoHealth), we urge that the lifestyle-microbiota-human health nexus be taken into account in societal decision making."
2,Psychometric properties of the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory among physically active Brazilian college men.,"A large body of knowledge already exists on muscle dysmorphia. However, the results are limited to studies with male bodybuilders and competitive weightlifters. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have pointed out limitations in several studies in which muscle dysmorphia symptoms are not assessed by valid and reliable instruments. Thus, this study aimed to describe the translation and cultural adaptation of the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory (MDDI) to Brazilian Portuguese and to evaluate its psychometric properties when applied to a total of 351 physically active Brazilian college men. Confirmatory factor analysis, convergent validity, estimated internal consistency, and test–retest reliability of the MDDI scores were examined. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis upheld the original 3-factor structure (13 items) of the MDDI for Brazilian men. The MDDI scores presented a significant moderate association with male body dissatisfaction and drive for muscularity. A significant small association was observed between MDDI scores and depressive symptoms and exercise dependence. Adequate internal consistency and 2-week test–retest reliability were found. The Brazilian version of MDDI showed adequate psychometric properties among physically active college men. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,Suggestion of cognitive enhancement improves emotion regulation.,"Cognitive training seems a promising approach to enhance emotion regulation. To establish a causal connection, researchers must compare the training intervention with a control group that accounts for improvements induced by some factors other than the training. Despite this familiar methodology, the influence of expectations on the transfer effects of training remains poorly understood. We tested this possibility in 2 experiments, where a procedure was designed to intentionally induce a placebo effect via the suggestion of cognitive enhancement to evaluate the role of expectation in emotion regulation gains from cognitive training. Both the Placebo and Control groups completed the identical short-term working memory training (20 min) in Experiment 1. New participants were recruited to complete a long-term pseudotraining program (7 days) in Experiment 2. The results from the 2 experiments consistently showed that the Placebo group, who expected benefits from the training, unlike the Control group, showed less negative emotion and better regulatory effects after pseudotraining, irrespective of the duration of the training. Thus, inadequate control of expectation is a fundamental design flaw that potentially undermines any causal inferences. These findings also suggest a novel perspective for optimizing the experimental designs in psychological interventions and advancing the understanding of emotion regulation enhancement.

3,Mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile.,"With one of the highest testing rates of COVID-19 in Latin America, Chile continues to record low mortality rates from the disease. Several measures such as curfews, cancellation of large gatherings, and closure of schools and businesses have been implemented. Against the backdrop of high levels of alcohol/substance abuse, mental health disorders, and inequalities across Chile, it is likely that levels of stress and anxiety will peak during the COVID-19 pandemic. As key public health responses such as testing, contact tracing, isolation and management of confirmed cases of COVID-19 are being ramped up, it is expedient to prioritize measures to safeguard the mental health of Chileans.

3,Mental health professionals with mental illnesses: A qualitative interview study.,"The purpose of this study is to explore the experiences of mental health professionals who self-identify as having a mental illness by analyzing how they describe their experiences in their own words. Twelve therapists volunteered to be interviewed for a larger study of working professionals living with mental illness that focused on perceived prejudice and discrimination in the workplace, revealing versus concealing one’s mental illness on the job, and how having a mental illness impacts one’s identity as a professional. This article reports on how these themes relate to practicing psychotherapists who are typically careful about with whom they share their mental health information. The results highlight that expressions of prejudice toward people with mental illnesses were commonplace among these mental health professionals and may contribute to an inclination among therapists to reveal their mental health history selectively, if at all, on the job. When it comes to sharing with clients, therapists tended to be thoughtful and deliberate about self-disclosure, only using it when they believed it would be beneficial to the client rather than to themselves. Regardless of whether they shared with clients, most of the therapists emphasized that having direct experience with mental illness enhanced their capacity to empathize with their clients, although sometimes empathy could trigger their own symptoms. The implications of these results for psychotherapists are discussed, including how psychotherapists with mental illness should care for themselves and how psychotherapists without mental illness can be more sensitive to their colleagues.

1,Microbiome networks and change-point analysis reveal key community changes associated with cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations,"Episodes of significant worsening of cystic fibrosis symptoms, known as pulmonary exacerbations (PEs), are associated with oxygen-deficient (anoxic) conditions and increased activity of ‘anaerobic’ bacteria, which thrive in the absence of oxygen. Researchers in Canada, led by David Guttman at the University of Toronto, compared genetic data on microbial populations in sputum samples collected during PEs and at times of better health. The study revealed a strong correlation between the activity and interactions among anaerobic bacteria and the onset of PEs. Investigating the significance of these changes in the lung environment and its microbial populations may help design treatment strategies to reduce the frequency of PEs and their potentially fatal consequences. The authors suggest that antibiotics that specifically target anaerobic bacteria may prove beneficial, as may hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which oxygenates the lung tissue."
3,Temporal matching between interoception and exteroception: Electrophysiological responses in a heartbeat discrimination task.,"Recent studies on interoception emphasize the importance of multisensory integration between interoception and exteroception. One of the methods frequently applied for assessing interoceptive sensitivity is the heartbeat discrimination task, where individuals judge whether the timing of external stimuli (e.g., tones) are synchronized to their own heartbeat. Despite its extensive use in research, the neural dynamics underlying the temporal matching between interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli in this task have remained unclear. The present study used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the neural responses of healthy participants who performed a heartbeat discrimination task. We analyzed the differences between EEG responses to tones, which were likely to be perceived as “heartbeat-synchronous” (200 ms delayed from the R wave) or “heartbeat-asynchronous” (0 ms delayed). Possible associations of these neural differentiations with task performance were also investigated. Compared with the responses to heartbeat-asynchronous tones, heartbeat-synchronous tones caused a relative decrease in early gamma-band EEG response and an increase in later P2 event-related potential (ERP) amplitude. Condition differences in the EEG/ERP measures were not significantly correlated with the behavioral measures. The mechanisms underlying the observed neural responses and the possibility of electrophysiological measurement of interoceptive sensitivity are discussed in terms of two perspectives: the predictive coding framework and the cardiac-phase-dependent baroreceptor function.

2,Context-dependent odor learning requires the anterior olfactory nucleus.,"Learning to associate the context in which a stimulus occurs is an important aspect of animal learning. We propose that the association of an olfactory stimulus with its multisensory context is mediated by projections from ventral hippocampus (vHC) networks to the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON). Using a contextually cued olfactory discrimination task, rats were trained to associate 2 olfactory stimuli with different responses depending on visuospatial context. Temporary lesions of the AON or vHC impaired performance on this task. In contrast, such lesions did not impair performance on a noncontextual olfactory discrimination task. Moreover, vHC lesions also impaired performance on an analogous contextually cued texture discrimination task, whereas AON lesions affected only olfactory contextual associations. We describe a distinct role for the AON in olfactory processing and conclude that early olfactory networks such as the olfactory bulb and AON function as multimodal integration networks rather than processing olfactory signals exclusively.

3,Depressive symptoms and blood pressure: A cross-sectional study of population data.,"In the present investigation it is hypothesized that depressive symptoms and antidepressant therapy are associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Moreover, in additional analyses, the interaction effects of age, gender, and depressive symptoms are estimated, and discussed in the context of previous findings. Data from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1) were analyzed (N = 7,987) by means of multi-response Bayesian hierarchical regression models. Missing data were imputed by the method of chain equations. Independent variables included depressive symptoms, antidepressant medication, gender, age, smoking, physical activity, family history of hypertension, body mass index, and antihypertensive medication. The estimates obtained in the multi-response model revealed that depressive symptoms were negatively associated with arterial blood pressure (−0.09, 99% CI [−0.147; −0.040]). Antidepressant therapy was found to be positively associated with increased blood pressure (1.035, 99% CI [0.333; 1.990]). There were negative interaction effects of depressive symptoms and age among women only (−0.006 99% CI [−0.010; −0.001]). The results agree with previous findings reporting a negative association between depressive symptoms and blood pressure. In addition, regarding the trajectory of blood pressure across the lifespan, interaction effects of depressive symptoms and age were found among females. The results indicate a linear increase in blood pressure with increasing age which, however, tends to flatten and decrease by around age 55 in both males and females. Potential physiological mechanisms may be related to affect regulation taking place at higher levels of cognitive processing and affecting blood pressure regulation, and/or cardiovascular mechanisms related to cerebral blood flow, arterial blood pressure, and depressive symptoms which have not been sufficiently explained so far.

A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in students (12 to 19 years of age) to examine the potential beneficial effects of IACBT-ESU (n = 62) compared with brief educational data alone (n = 62). Symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and peer relations were also compared between the two groups. The IACBT-ESU group demonstrated significant reductions in excessive smartphone use, with reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, hyperactivity, and emotional difficulties at both trial end and at 3-month follow-up (p < .01) compared with control participants. IACBT-ESU was associated with reduced excessive smartphone use and improved psychological well-being, with beneficial findings maintained 3 months after the trial’s end.

1,Diversity of the oral microbiome between dentate and edentulous individuals,"BACKGROUND: Measurement of saliva microbes is promoted as a way to detect oral and systemic disease, yet there is a multitude of factors that affect the oral microbiome. The salivary microbiome is influenced by oral biofilm of shedding (epithelial) and non-shedding (tooth) surfaces. \ METHODS: To gauge the ability of salivary microbial analytics to distinguish between edentulous and dentate oral conditions, we looked for differences in the saliva microbiome of subjects with and without teeth. Fifty-two dentate and 49 edentulous subjects provided stimulated saliva samples. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, QIIME-based data processing, and statistical analysis were done using several different analytical approaches to detect differences in the salivary microbiome between the two groups. \ RESULTS: Bacteria diversity was lower in the edentulous group. Remarkably, all 31 of the most significant differences in taxa were deficits that occur in the edentulous group. As one might expect many of these taxa are attributed to dental plaque and gingival sulcus associated bacteria. \ CONCLUSION: In sum, the measurement of 16S rRNA genes in the bacteria of the saliva can be used to reproducibly measure differences in the oral microbiome that occur with edentulism, mainly the lack of tooth and tooth-related structures."
1,Effect of the Nursing Mother on the Gut Microbiome of the Offspring During Early Mouse Development,"The development of the gut microbiome is influenced by several factors. It is acquired during and after birth and involves both maternal and environmental factors as well as the genetic disposition of the offspring. However, it is unclear if the microbiome development is directly triggered by the mode of delivery and very early contact with the mother or mostly at later stages of initial development mainly by breast milk provided by the mother. To investigate to what extent the gut microbiome composition of the offspring is determined by the nursing mother, providing breast milk, compared to the birth mother during early development, a cross-fostering experiment involving two genetically different mouse lines was developed, being prone to be obese or lean, respectively. The microbiome of the colon was analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, when the mice were 3 weeks old. The nursing mother affected both α- and β-diversity of the offspring's gut microbiome and shaped its composition. Especially bacterial families directly transferred by breast milk, like Streptococcaceae, or families which are strongly influenced by the quality of the breast milk like Rikenellaceae, showed a strong response. The core microbiome transferred from the obese nursing mother showed a higher robustness in comparison to the microbiome transferred from the lean nursing mother. Overall, the nursing mother impacts the gut microbial composition of the offspring during early development and might play an important role for health and disease of the animals at later stages of life."
3,Integrating medical examiner and police report data: Can this improve our knowledge of the social circumstances surrounding suicide?,"Background: Recently, suicide in the United States has begun to be viewed as a preventable public health issue. This has led to the creation of a National Violent Death Reporting System that collects and integrates data on the social circumstances surrounding suicides. Aims: The study examines data on social circumstances surrounding suicides as collected by the medical examiner report (ME) and police report (PR) and subsequently integrated into the state of Maryland’s violent death reporting system. Methods: Reported data on social circumstances surrounding suicides occurring in the years 2003–2006 in Maryland (n = 1,476) were analyzed by examining their prevalence in the ME and PR, strength of association, and integration. Results: With the exception of three circumstances, there was variation among reported circumstances in the ME and PR. Furthermore, there was only a moderately strong relationship between the ME and PR for most circumstances, while a significant increase occurred in the prevalence of these circumstances when ME and PR were integrated. Conclusions: The integration of ME and PR has the potential to increase our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding suicide and to better inform prevention efforts. However, before this potential can be reached, there are still issues that must be considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,"Relationships between depression, self-reflection, brooding, and creative thinking in a psychiatric sample.","Although symptoms of depression likely interfere with creative thinking, rates of mood disorders appear to be higher than average in creative samples. Previous research has shown that a possible link between depression and creativity might best be explained by self-reflection, defined as the tendency to ponder or contemplate information related to the self. However, previous findings are constrained by the use of nonclinical student samples and the inability to examine the role of specific diagnoses associated with depressive symptoms. To extend previous research, the present study investigated cross-sectional relationships between depressive symptoms, self-reflection, brooding, and the generation of original and valuable ideas in a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample (n = 230). Results from path analyses showed that across the total sample, self-reflection did not significantly relate to outcomes. In contrast, depressive symptoms related to lower originality, and brooding related to higher value. Relationships were not moderated by a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. These findings suggest that depressive symptoms relate to different aspects of creative thinking (i.e., the ability to come up with original vs. valuable ideas) in contradictory ways. We discuss implications for the study of creativity, and emphasize the need to communicate these findings accurately and effectively in clinical contexts to support recovery and mood stability.

However, the prevalence of flourishing is barely 20% in the adult population, indicating the need for a national program on mental health promotion to complement ongoing efforts to prevent and treat mental illness.

3,What can we learn from shamans’ dreaming? A cross-cultural exploration.,"Shamanism is a worldwide social phenomenon consisting of a set of practices (e.g., ritualistic drumming, sensory deprivation, the ingestion of entheogens and dream incubation) designed to obtain knowledge from alternative realities for the purpose of benefiting one’s social group. The aim of this paper is to provide a cross-cultural exploration of dreaming in the context of shamanism. We proceed by addressing 2 fundamental questions: What is meant by the terms shaman and shamanic principle, and what is the distinction between monophasic and polyphasic social groups with regards to the veridicality and cultural significance of dreams? It will be demonstrated that the kind of society in which shamanism arises (groups having polyphasic cultures) is quite different compared to modern materialistic/technocratic society (those having monophasic cultures). Subsequently, our cross-cultural investigation of shamanic dreaming focuses on the shamanic call, initiation and healing. Finally, we elucidate the major elements of core shamanism as they appear to influence dreaming, dream interpretation and dream culture, and suggest that in fact dreaming invites shamanism.

3,"Protective factors, campus climate, and health outcomes among sexual minority college students.","Heterosexism on campus can create a chilly climate for sexual minority students. Research has documented the negative impacts of campus climate on sexual minority students’ health; however, little research has examined the role of potential protective factors among this population. Drawing on data collected from self-identified sexual minority students as part of a larger campus climate study, we examine the relationship between heterosexism on campus (experiential and psychological) and mental health (depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse) and negative physical health symptoms. To explore potential protective factors, we investigate the role of individual-level (self-esteem and physical exercise) and interpersonal-level (LGB friends and instructor relations) variables on the climate-mental/physical health relationships. Our findings suggest that experiencing heterosexist harassment, but not perceived attitudes toward sexual minorities, is a risk factor for all 4 outcomes. Further, exercise moderated the impacts of heterosexist harassment on depression and anxiety, self-esteem and LGB friends moderated the impacts of heterosexist harassment on risk for alcohol abuse, and instructor relations moderated the relationship between heterosexist harassment and negative physical health symptoms. Practitioners and researchers should consider the specific buffering impacts of protective factors on health outcomes among sexual minority students.

1,"Engineering root microbiomes for healthier crops and soils using beneficial, environmentally safe bacteria","The Green Revolution developed new crop varieties, which greatly improved food security worldwide. However, the growth of these plants relied heavily on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which have led to an overuse of synthetic fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides with serious environmental consequences and negative effects on human health. Environmentally friendly plant-growth-promoting methods to replace our current reliance on synthetic chemicals and to develop more sustainable agricultural practices to offset the damage caused by many agrochemicals are proposed herein. The increased use of bioinoculants, which consist of microorganisms that establish synergies with target crops and influence production and yield by enhancing plant growth, controlling disease, and providing critical mineral nutrients, is a potential solution. The microorganisms found in bioinoculants are often bacteria or fungi that reside within either external or internal plant microbiomes. However, before they can be used routinely in agriculture, these microbes must be confirmed as nonpathogenic strains that promote plant growth and survival. In this article, besides describing approaches for discovering plant-growth-promoting bacteria in various environments, including phytomicrobiomes and soils, we also discuss methods to evaluate their safety for the environment and for human health."
3,Mentorship: The necessity of intentionality.,"A large body of research exists that is dedicated to exploring and defining mentoring. It is widely recognized that mentorship is a process informed by one’s personal experiences. Yet, mentorship literature primarily centers around advancing technical proficiencies, and very little focuses on individual characteristics, such as honesty, consistency, and transparency. Individual wisdom is an invaluable tool for intentional mentorship. Intentional mentors catalyze the ability to understand and tap into one’s own power, promote awareness of individual strengths and limitations, and clarify personal vision. Through intentional mentorship, mentors identify, improve, and implement strategies and skills that they acquired throughout their career. After conducting a self-assessment and identifying the personal skills that can be attributed to effective mentoring, mentors advance along the mentorship continuum to improve, and subsequently implement, these skills. Given the changing landscape of the scientific workforce in general, faculty mentors must be intentional about seeking avenues for growth. Beyond individual implementation, it is essential for educational institutions to also take a systemic approach when it comes to supporting faculty advisors and their mentees. A few tools and resources are offered to encourage mentors in taking a proactive role as they intentionally develop and enhance their individual mentoring process.

1,Birth mode is associated with earliest strain-conferred gut microbiome functions and immunostimulatory potential,"The rate of caesarean section delivery (CSD) is increasing worldwide. It remains unclear whether disruption of mother-to-neonate transmission of microbiota through CSD occurs and whether it affects human physiology. Here we perform metagenomic analysis of earliest gut microbial community structures and functions. We identify differences in encoded functions between microbiomes of vaginally delivered (VD) and CSD neonates. Several functional pathways are over-represented in VD neonates, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. We link these enriched functions to individual-specific strains, which are transmitted from mothers to neonates in case of VD. The stimulation of primary human immune cells with LPS isolated from early stool samples of VD neonates results in higher levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin 18 (IL-18). Accordingly, the observed levels of TNF-α and IL-18 in neonatal blood plasma are higher after VD. Taken together, our results support that CSD disrupts mother-to-neonate transmission of specific microbial strains, linked functional repertoires and immune-stimulatory potential during a critical window for neonatal immune system priming."

Here we review recent knowledge about the impacts on infant microbiome assembly, discuss preventive and restorative strategies to ameliorate the effects of these impacts, and highlight where research is needed to advance this field and improve the health of future generations."
1,Mode of Delivery – Effects on Gut Microbiota and Humoral Immunity,"<i>Background:</i> The rate of caesarean deliveries has increased 10-fold worldwide during the past decades. <i>Objective:</i> To evaluate differences in the establishment of gut microbiota in infants born by vaginal or caesarean delivery and its impact on mucosal immunity. <i>Methods:</i> Altogether, 165 consecutive children, prospectively followed from birth at our clinic in Turku, Finland, were gathered; 141 (85%) were born by vaginal delivery and 24 (15%) by caesarean section. Blood was drawn at physician visits for indirect evaluation of mucosal immunity by ELISPOT assay. Faecal samples were obtained for determination of the gut microbiota by fluorescence in situ hybridization of bacterial cells. <i>Results:</i> Infants delivered by caesarean section harboured fewer bifidobacteria at an early age and were shown to mount a stronger humoral immune response. At 1 month of age, the total gut bacterial cell counts per 1 g faeces were higher in vaginally delivered infants (9.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>, 95% CI 7.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>–1.2 × 10<sup>10</sup>) as compared to caesarean section delivered (3.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>, 95% CI 1.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>–8.6 × 10<sup>9</sup>) (p = 0.001). This distinction was mainly due to the greater number of bifidobacteria in vaginally delivered infants (1.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>, 95% CI 6.3 × 10<sup>8</sup>–5.6 × 10<sup>9</sup> vs. 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 95% CI 4.1 × 10<sup>2</sup>–5.7 × 10<sup>9</sup>, respectively) (p = 0.001). During the first year of life, the total number of IgA-, IgG- and IgM-secreting cells was lower (p = 0.03, p = 0.02, p = 0.11, respectively) in infants born by vaginal delivery than in those born by caesarean section, possibly reflecting excessive antigen exposure across the vulnerable gut barrier. <i>Conclusions:</i> Our findings demonstrate that the mode of delivery may have, possibly via gut microbiota development, significant effects on immunological functions in the infant (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00167700)."

2,Can the curse of knowing be lifted? The influence of explicit perspective-focus instructions on readers’ perspective-taking.,"Perceivers of other minds often overestimate the similarity between their own and other people’s perspectives. This egocentric projection during perspective-taking is argued to originate from perceivers’ tendency to use their own perspective as a referential anchor from which they insufficiently adjust away to account for an alternative interpretation. We investigated whether an explicit focus on another person’s point of view allows perceivers to make sufficient perspective-adjustments, thereby attenuating their egocentric projection. Findings showed that we successfully replicated Keysar’s (1994) illusory transparency of intention effect (Experiment 1) and Epley, Keysar, Van Boven, and Gilovich’s (2004) findings that confirm perceivers’ egocentric anchoring and (insufficient) adjustment during perspective-taking (Experiment 2). We further showed that enhancing perceivers’ attention to another person’s perspective both prior (Experiment 1) and during (Experiment 2) perspective-taking did not diminish egocentric projection. Findings are discussed in light of the role of feedback in making accurate perspective-adjustments. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,"A Survey of Culturable Fungal Endophytes From Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa, a Grass From Marine Cliffs, Reveals a Core Microbiome","Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa is a perennial grass that inhabits sea cliffs of the Atlantic coasts of Europe. In this unhospitable environment plants grow in rock crevices and are exposed to abiotic stress factors such as low nutrient availability, wind, and salinity. Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa is a host of the fungal endophyte Epichloë festucae, which colonizes aerial organs, but its root mycobiota is unknown. The culturable endophytic mycobiota of FRP roots was surveyed in a set of 105 plants sampled at five populations in marine cliffs from the northern coast of Spain. In total, 135 different fungal taxa were identified, 17 of them occurred in more than 10% of plants and in two or more populations. Seven taxa belonging to Fusarium, Diaporthe, Helotiales, Drechslera, Slopeiomyces and Penicillium appeared to be constituents of the core microbiome of Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa roots because they occurred in more than 20% of the plants analyzed, and at three or more populations. Most fungal strains analyzed (71.8%) were halotolerant. The presence of Epichloë festucae in aboveground tissue was detected in 65.7 % of the plants, but its presence did not seem to significantly affect the structure of the core or other root microbiota, when compared to that of plants free of this endophyte. When plants of the grass Lolium perenne were inoculated with fungal strains obtained from Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa roots, a Diaporthe strain significantly promoted leaf biomass production under normal and saline (200 mM NaCl) watering regimes. These results suggest that the core mycobiome of Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa could have a role in host plant adaptation, and might be useful for the improvement of agricultural grasses."
2,Acute NMDA receptor antagonism impairs working memory performance but not attention in rats—Implications for the NMDAr hypofunction theory of schizophrenia.,"Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, which include impairments in working memory and attention, represent some of the most disabling symptoms of this complex psychiatric condition, and lack effective treatments. NMDA receptor (NMDAr) hypofunction is a strong candidate mechanism underlying schizophrenia pathophysiology, and has been modeled preclinically using acute administration of NMDAr antagonists to rodents to investigate biological mechanisms underpinning cognitive dysfunction. However, whether and how NMDAr hypofunction specifically influences all affected cognitive domains is unclear. Here we studied the effects of the NMDAr antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine) on tasks of attention and working memory in rats using automated touchscreen chambers. Adult male Wistar rats were trained to perform the trial-unique nonmatching to location (TUNL) task of spatial working memory, or the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT) of attention. Once trained, rats received injection of vehicle (saline) or low-dose MK-801 (0.06 mg/kg sc) 10 min prior to commencing test sessions. MK-801 significantly impaired working memory, as evidenced by reduced performance accuracy on the TUNL task (p < .0001), compared with vehicle. However, we found no significant effects on attentional processing or perseveration on the 5CSRTT. Additional measures indicated that MK-801 impaired behavioral flexibility in the TUNL task, and decreased response inhibition in both tasks. Using the automated touchscreen system to measure different cognitive functions under the same testing environment, we demonstrate that spatial working memory, response inhibition, and behavioral flexibility are more vulnerable to NMDAr hypofunction than attentional processing. This may have implications for the NMDAr hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,The salivary microbiome of diabetic and non-diabetic adults with periodontal disease,"BACKGROUND: A comparison of the salivary microbiome of non-diabetic and diabetic cohorts having periodontal health, gingivitis and periodontitis could reveal microbial signatures unique to each group that will increase understanding of the role of oral microbiota in the pathogenesis of disease, and assist with diagnosis and risk assessment for both periodontal disease and diabetes. \ METHODS: A group of individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) was compared with a group without T2D. For both the diabetic and non-diabetic cohorts, three subgroups were established: periodontal health, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Salivary DNA was extracted (n = 146), polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify 16S rRNA hypervariable region V3-V4, and constructed libraries were sequenced and subjected to bioinformatic and statistical analyses. \ RESULTS: Microbiome analysis resulted in 88 different genus level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for differential abundance testing. Results were largely described by two trends. Trend 1 showed OTUs that increased in abundance with increasing periodontal disease, and in diabetics relative to non-diabetics. Trend 1 OTUs comprised a mix of primarily anaerobic commensals and potential periodontopathogens. Trend 2 was driven primarily by genera that decreased in abundance in those with diabetes relative to those without diabetes, which included other anaerobes associated with periodontal disease. Overall, oral microbial diversity decreased in diabetics and increased with progression of periodontal disease compared with periodontally healthy controls. \ CONCLUSION: Although select microbiota increased in both diabetes and periodontal disease progression, these genera decreased in co-existing diabetes and periodontal disease. These findings suggest that the genera abundance continues to change with additional stress imposed by co-existing conditions."
3,The relationship between religiosity and subjective well-being: A case of Kuwaiti car accident victims.,"Researchers have long recognized the influence of religion on a person’s health and well-being. This study explores the influence of religion on the wellbeing of traumatized people. The study population included people who had experienced significant trauma in their lives from a severe car accident. The study sample included individuals who had been traumatized through severe injury in car accidents, families of those who have been badly injured, and families of those who were killed in car accidents. Demographic and socioeconomic variables served as independent factors in measuring subjective well-being. Descriptive, bivariate, and multiple regression analyses were used to measure the relationship between religiosity and subjective well-being of a traumatized person. Results showed that there was a positive relationship between religiosity and well-being, that income of the traumatized affected well-being positively, and that age of the traumatized affected well-being negatively. There was no effect of group difference (severely injured, family of severely injured, and family of a killed one) on well-being. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,Epidemiologic characteristics of suicidal behavior in contemporary Ghana.,"Background: Suicidal behavior receives considerable coverage in African media. Yet, there has been limited empirical research that focuses explicitly on suicidal behavior in African societies, while comprehensive and reliable official data on the phenomenon are limited. Aims: This article contributes to the empirical research on suicidal behavior in African societies by examining police-recorded data on suicidal behavior in Ghana, West Africa. Methods: Official law enforcement data on suicidal behavior spanning 2006–2008 were analyzed to identify current patterns of suicidal behavior in the country. Results: The results indicate that the persons most prone to suicidal behavior were male, young, and poor. The most frequent methods used were hanging, the ingestion of poisons, and shooting. Conclusions: The relatively low rate of recorded suicidal behavior in the society stems partly from the tabooed and criminal aspects of the phenomenon.

3,“It lit up the campus”: Engaging Black males in culturally enriching environments.,"As the presence of Black male-centered programs increase on college campuses around the nation, this study focused on identifying the benefits Black male collegians receive through engagement in these programs. This in-depth, qualitative study explored the experiences of five Black male students in the Black Male Leadership Collective (BMLC), a Black male initiative program at a midsized historically White 4-year institution. In particular, we used Museus’ (2014) culturally engaging campus environment model as a conceptual frame to analyze and understand the men’s experiences in the BMLC. While providing personal narratives, the students expressed how the BMLC served as a culturally enriching environment and contributed positively to their overall college experience. Students attributed their participation in the BMLC to three critical factors that improved their college tenures: gaining brotherhood through their Black male peer-to-peer bonding (cultural familiarity, collectivist cultural orientations, and cultural community service), being provided with and enmeshed in a support network (culturally validating environment, humanized educational environment, and holistic support), and enhancing their personal development (culturally relevant knowledge and proactive philosophies). As the student narratives attest, each of these elements, individually and collectively, augmented their engagement on campus and supported their resilience and persistence to graduation. Implications for supporting Black male collegians through similar programs are addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,The gut microbiome in anorexia nervosa: relevance for nutritional rehabilitation,"Rapidly accumulating evidence supports the important role of gut microbiome in the regulation of mood, behaviour, appetite, gastrointestinal symptomology, and nutrient metabolism. These are all core features frequently altered in individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). Current treatment recommendations for AN support the use of high-calorie diets as an essential part of nutritional rehabilitation, commonly achieved by elevating the fat content of the diet. However, in contrast to this approach, there is accumulating evidence suggesting the importance of balanced, high-fibre diets on the gut microbiome. Studies have demonstrated profound differences in the microbial composition of underweight people with AN and those of normal- or overweight individuals. Specific alterations vary widely between studies. It is thus far unclear to what extent the observed differences are brought on by iatrogenic effects of nutritional rehabilitation or the disorder itself. To date, only two studies have investigated the changes in the intestinal microbiota during nutritional rehabilitation and corresponding weight restoration. These studies suggest that the gut microbiome of AN patients was different to healthy controls both prior and following nutritional rehabilitation, though it is noted that these states were associated with lower and higher nutritional intakes, respectively. There is a clear need for further investigation regarding the effects of nutritional rehabilitation on the gut microbiome. Such research would provide insights into the potential role of gut microbiome in modulating the pathophysiology of AN and inform future treatment strategies."
1,The Microbiome and Genitourinary Cancer: A Collaborative Review,"Context \ The recent discovery of the existence of a human genitourinary microbiome has led to the investigation of its role in mediating the pathogenesis of genitourinary malignancies, including bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers. Furthermore, although it is largely recognized that members of the gastrointestinal microbiota are actively involved in drug metabolism, new studies demonstrate additional roles and the potential necessity of the gastrointestinal microbiota in dictating cancer treatment response. \ Objective \ To summarize the current evidence of a mechanistic role for the genitourinary and gastrointestinal microbiome in genitourinary cancer initiation and treatment response. \ Evidence acquisition \ We conducted a literature search up to October 2018. Search terms included microbiome, microbiota, urinary microbiome, bladder cancer, urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and prostate cancer. \ Evidence synthesis \ There is preliminary evidence to implicate the members of the genitourinary microbiota as causative factors or cofactors in genitourinary malignancy. Likewise, the current evidence for gastrointestinal microbes in dictating cancer treatment response is mainly correlative; however, we provide examples where therapeutic agents used for the treatment of genitourinary cancers are affected by the human-associated microbiota, or vice versa. Clinical trials, such as fecal microbiota transplant to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy, are currently underway. \ Conclusions \ The role of the microbiome in genitourinary cancer is an emerging field that merits further studies. Translating microbiome research into clinical action will require incorporation of microbiome surveillance into ongoing and future clinical trials as well as expansion of studies to include metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics. \ Patient summary \ This review covers recent evidence that microbial populations that reside in the genitourinary tract—and were previously not known to exist—may influence the development of genitourinary malignancies including bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers. Furthermore, microbial populations that exist at sites outside of the genitourinary tract, such as those that reside in our gut, may influence cancer development and/or treatment response."
1,Enterotypes of the human gut microbiome,"Our knowledge of species and functional composition of the human gut microbiome is rapidly increasing, but it is still based on very few cohorts and little is known about variation across the world. By combining 22 newly sequenced faecal metagenomes of individuals from four countries with previously published data sets, here we identify three robust clusters (referred to as enterotypes hereafter) that are not nation or continent specific. We also confirmed the enterotypes in two published, larger cohorts, indicating that intestinal microbiota variation is generally stratified, not continuous. This indicates further the existence of a limited number of well-balanced host-microbial symbiotic states that might respond differently to diet and drug intake. The enterotypes are mostly driven by species composition, but abundant molecular functions are not necessarily provided by abundant species, highlighting the importance of a functional analysis to understand microbial communities. Although individual host properties such as body mass index, age, or gender cannot explain the observed enterotypes, data-driven marker genes or functional modules can be identified for each of these host properties. For example, twelve genes significantly correlate with age and three functional modules with the body mass index, hinting at a diagnostic potential of microbial markers."

However, the interrelations of depressive symptoms, personal resources, and coping as antecedents of stressful experiences are largely unknown. For this investigation, a prospective design was used to test a model estimating two categories of daily hassles at Time 2 in relation to depressive symptoms, self-esteem, gender, coping, and daily hassles at Time 1. Utilizing simultaneous equations, direct effects were observed for depressive symptoms, Time 1 hassles, gender, and avoidance coping in relation to category of hassles at Time 2.

2,What lies ahead: Elevated concerns for the ongoing suicide pandemic.,"The genesis and global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in significant health concerns amid societies that were ill-equipped for such a formidable opponent. The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated systemic health disparities and weaknesses within our health care and political systems. With aggressive but necessary interventions to thwart the instantaneous reproduction number, we have simultaneously introduced risk factors for new and exacerbated mental health concerns. Suicide, an ongoing pandemic whose rates are higher than they have been in the past 50 years, is one of these concerns as we navigate COVID-19 deaths and fears surrounding its spread. This article aims to briefly describe in retrospect some of the historical pandemics and their downstream consequences as well as present what may lie ahead in terms of anxiety, depression, and suicidal behaviors. This applies not only to frontline health care workers but also the public at large, who may very well experience long-term stressor- and trauma-related consequences through ongoing exposure to a virus that is not only potentially fatal but may have taken the lives of loved ones.

3,“The poor kids’ table”: Organizing around an invisible and stigmatized identity in flux.,"Research has demonstrated that the low-income, first-generation, and/or working-class (LIFGWC) student experience of higher education can be alienating and isolating. Because social class status is not often visible, LIFGWC students, who are the minority on 4-year college campuses, may have difficulty finding others with whom they share similar experiences and, therefore, be less likely to integrate socially. In order to alleviate the pain and discomfort of the LIFGWC experience in higher education, students have worked to start groups for LIFGWC students on college campuses across the United States. In this study we use ethnographic methods to better understand the formation and maintenance of one such group at a small, selective liberal arts college in the Northeast. Through the inductive analysis of interviews with 16 students affiliated with the group, we identify two central themes. First, the invisible, individualist, and fluid nature of social class identity made for a unique challenge in organizing and recruiting members for the group. Second, the group leaders’ decision to engage in awareness-raising activities was met with hesitancy by some members. Students differed in their availability or level of comfort to engage in social class based activism on campus and in their existing ties to the campus community, both of which shaped their further involvement in the group. We conclude by outlining policy implications and future research directions informed by our findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,Exact variance component tests for longitudinal microbiome studies,"In metagenomic studies, testing the association between microbiome composition and clinical outcomes translates to testing the nullity of variance components. Motivated by a lung human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) microbiome project, we study longitudinal microbiome data by using variance component models with more than two variance components. Current testing strategies only apply to models with exactly two variance components and when sample sizes are large. Therefore, they are not applicable to longitudinal microbiome studies. In this paper, we propose exact tests (score test, likelihood ratio test, and restricted likelihood ratio test) to (a) test the association of the overall microbiome composition in a longitudinal design and (b) detect the association of one specific microbiome cluster while adjusting for the effects from related clusters. Our approach combines the exact tests for null hypothesis with a single variance component with a strategy of reducing multiple variance components to a single one. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method has a correct type I error rate and superior power compared to existing methods at small sample sizes and weak signals. Finally, we apply our method to a longitudinal pulmonary microbiome study of HIV-infected patients and reveal two interesting genera Prevotella and Veillonella associated with forced vital capacity. Our findings shed light on the impact of the lung microbiome on HIV complexities. The method is implemented in the open-source, high-performance computing language Julia and is freely available at https://github.com/JingZhai63/VCmicrobiome."
2,Temporal dynamics of free recall: The role of rehearsal efficiency in word frequency and bilingual language proficiency effects.,"Under a recall model in which presentations and rehearsals are treated as equivalent encoding events, we investigated whether rehearsal efficiency differences explain the effects of word frequency and bilingual proficiency on the temporal dynamics of rehearsal and free recall. Experiments 1 and 3 were conducted with monolingual English speakers, and Experiments 2 and 4 were conducted with Spanish-English bilinguals with matched age, education, and socioeconomic status. In Experiments 1 and 2, lower word frequency, lower proficiency, and bilingualism were associated with less accurate free recall of items from early serial positions, beginning recall with items from later serial positions, and making fewer transitions to items from later or adjacent serial positions. These effects were replicated and rehearsal-based explanations were validated in Experiments 3 and 4 using a rehearse-aloud protocol. With lower frequency words or lower language proficiency, rehearsal was less efficient with fewer rehearsals between item presentations. As a result, items from early serial positions had fewer rehearsals that stopped earlier in the study sequence, less spacing between repeated rehearsals, and fewer transitions to items from later or adjacent serial positions. Rehearsal-contingent analyses revealed that these rehearsal patterns were associated with less accurate recall, beginning recall with items from later serial positions, and consistent transition patterns from rehearsal to recall. These patterns support a model in which presentations and rehearsals are treated as equivalent encoding events and the effects of word frequency and language proficiency on recall accuracy are mediated by less efficient rehearsal.

3,Microwave detection and quantification of water hidden in and on building materials: implications for healthy buildings and microbiome studies,"Background: Excess water in all its forms (moisture, dampness, hidden water) in buildings negatively impacts occupant health but is hard to reliably detect and quantify. Recent advances in through-wall imaging recommend microwaves as a tool with a high potential to noninvasively detect and quantify water throughout buildings.; Methods: Microwaves in both transmission and reflection (radar) modes were used to perform a simple demonstration of the detection of water both on and hidden within building materials.; Results: We used both transmission and reflection modes to detect as little as 1 mL of water between two 7 cm thicknesses of concrete. The reflection mode was also used to detect 1 mL of water on a metal surface. We observed oscillations in transmitted and reflected microwave amplitude as a function of microwave wavelength and water layer thickness, which we attribute to thin-film interference effects.; Conclusions: Improving the detection of water in buildings could help design, maintenance, and remediation become more efficient and effective and perhaps increase the value of microbiome sequence data. Microwave characterization of all forms of water throughout buildings is possible; its practical development would require new collaborations among microwave physicists or engineers, architects, building engineers, remediation practitioners, epidemiologists, and microbiologists.;"
3,Professionals' perceptions of the obstacles to education for people using mental health services.,"Objective: This article focuses on the preliminary findings of a research project investigating the barriers to participation in education for persons using mental health services. Methods: A questionnaire was administered to 380 care coordinators in community health teams in the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust to elicit their views on three areas where possible obstacles may be encountered: physical and psychological barriers found at an individual level, and structural barriers at the service level. Seventy care coordinators, predominantly community psychiatric nurses, replied and reported the barriers they saw facing 140 service users, all of whom were diagnosed with a severe mental illness. Results: Analysis of the physical and psychological obstacles indicated that fluctuating illness was the major barrier, with mobility the least problematic issue. The average number of substantial barriers faced by an individual was five. Lack of funding for courses was the biggest service-related obstacle, closely followed by lack of information and opportunities for education. Low expectations on the part of mental health practitioners were seen as the least important service-related issue. Conclusions: Recommendations for service development highlight the role of education in recovery from mental illness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,Belief digitization: Do we treat uncertainty as probabilities or as bits?,"Humans are often characterized as Bayesian reasoners. Here, we question the core Bayesian assumption that probabilities reflect degrees of belief. Across eight studies, we find that people instead reason in a digital manner, assuming that uncertain information is either true or false when using that information to make further inferences. Participants learned about 2 hypotheses, both consistent with some information but one more plausible than the other. Although people explicitly acknowledged that the less-plausible hypothesis had positive probability, they ignored this hypothesis when using the hypotheses to make predictions. This was true across several ways of manipulating plausibility (simplicity, evidence fit, explicit probabilities) and a diverse array of task variations. Taken together, the evidence suggests that digitization occurs in prediction because it circumvents processing bottlenecks surrounding people’s ability to simulate outcomes in hypothetical worlds. These findings have implications for philosophy of science and for the organization of the mind. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,The Ocular Microbiome: Molecular Characterisation of a Unique and Low Microbial Environment,"AIM: The ocular surface is continually exposed to bacteria from the environment and traditional culture-based microbiological studies have isolated a low diversity of microorganisms from this region. The use of culture-independent methods to define the ocular microbiome, primarily involving 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing studies, have shown that the microbial communities present on the ocular surface have a greater diversity than previously reported. \ METHOD: A review of the literature on ocular microbiome research in health and disease. \ RESULTS: Molecular techniques have been used to investigate the effect of contact lens wear and disease on the microbiota of the ocular surface and eyelids and the immunoregulatory role of the ocular surface microbiota. Studies have shown that compositional changes in the microbiota occur in ocular surface disorders such as blepharitis, trachoma and dry eye and also suggest a role of the ocular and non-ocular microbiome in retinal disease including age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, uveitis and diabetic retinopathy. However, ocular microbiome studies need to recognise the potential for contamination to impact findings and carefully control each stage of the experimental procedure and to utilise statistical methods to identify contamination signals. \ CONCLUSION: The healthy ocular surface is characterised by a relatively stable, comparatively low diversity microbiome with recent findings that the bacteria of the ocular surface appear to have a role in maintaining homeostasis by modulating immune function."
2,Conceptualization and measurement of birth family thoughts for adolescents and adults adopted transnationally.,"For adopted individuals, understanding the role of birth family is an important part of developing a coherent life narrative. However, there is limited empirical research on this aspect of the adoption experience. We introduce a new construct, birth family thoughts, that captures a sense of curiosity about birth family, and describe the development of an accompanying brief self-report measure, the Birth Family Thoughts Scale (BFTS). Across 4 studies of transnationally adopted Korean American adolescents, emerging adults, and adults who were adopted before the age of 3 (ncombined = 546), we found strong support for a 1-factor structure using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and good internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Convergent validity was generally supported. The BFTS was positively related to measures of adoption- and ethnicity-related constructs, although there were a few inconsistencies between studies and measures. Discriminant validity also was generally supported. We found no evidence for the BFTS being related to a poor adoptive family situation or an indication of psychopathology. We did find some evidence of the BFTS relating to internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Furthermore, while the BFTS was unrelated to travel to Korea, it was correlated with visiting an orphanage in Korea. It was also related to initiating a birth family search in Study 1, but not in Studies 2 or 3. We discuss the importance of considering birth family thoughts across the life span and with other populations, as well as the limitations of the current study including sampling issues inherent in working with hard-to-reach populations.

2,The role of information search in creative problem solving.,"This study investigates the role that information search behavior plays in the process of creative problem solving. Although models of creative processing posit that information search is a necessary stage of creative problem solving, no research has separated and measured information search from earlier processes to determine the nature of the role it plays in the creative problem solving process. Two hundred twenty-one people participated in a study where active engagement in problem construction was manipulated. Participants were allowed to search for additional information that may facilitate the generation of a creative solution. Measures of information search that have been shown to influence performance on decision-making tasks were captured. The results indicated that the length of time spent searching, the quantity of information viewed, and the breadth of information search mediate the relationship between problem construction engagement and creativity across categories. Furthermore, the relationship between the efficiency of information search and creativity depends upon problem construction engagement. For people who engaged in problem construction, the more efficiently they searched for information, the more creative their solution. The efficiency of information search had no impact on creativity for people who did not engage in information search. The implications of these findings as they relate to the overall field of creative problem-solving are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,Impulsivity and midlife cardiometabolic risk: The role of maladaptive health behaviors.,"Objective: The present study evaluated distinct facets of impulsivity related to cardiometabolic risk (CMR) to identify specific behavioral mechanisms driving these relationships. Method: Community adults (N = 1,295) between 30 and 54 years old (53% female, 84% White) completed a battery of impulsivity measures, reported their engagement in health behaviors over the past week (i.e., cigarette smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and dietary intake), and were assessed for CMR factors (i.e., blood pressure, insulin resistance, adiposity, and blood lipids). Structural equation modeling was used to estimate previously established hierarchical models of distinct facets of impulsivity and CMR. Indirect effects through the observed health behaviors were examined for each association between the latent impulsivity factors identified and the latent CMR factor. Results: Neuroticism/negative emotionality was the only latent impulsivity factor directly related to heightened CMR (β = 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.01, 0.16], p = .020). Extraversion/positive emotionality indirectly related to lower CMR through greater physical activity (β = −0.04, 95% CI [−0.06, −0.02], p p = .045) and delay discounting (β = 0.08, 95% CI [0.001, 0.15], p = .049) indirectly related to CMR through saturated fat intake. Conclusions: These findings indicate that distinct facets of impulsivity differentially relate to CMR through varied behavioral pathways and identify physical activity and saturated fat intake as being particularly important health behaviors to target when tailoring treatment approaches to the unique behavioral characteristics of individuals high on certain facets of impulsivity.

3,A meta-analysis of the association between Caesarean section and childhood asthma,"Background Children born by Caesarean section have modified intestinal bacterial colonization and consequently may have an increased risk of developing asthma under the hygiene hypothesis. The results of previous studies that have investigated the association between Caesarean section and asthma have been conflicting. Objective To review published literature and perform a meta-analysis summarizing the evidence in support of an association between children born by Caesarean section and asthma. Methods MEDLINE, Web Science, Google Scholar and PubMed were searched to identify relevant studies. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each study from the reported prevalence of asthma in children born by Caesarean section and in control children. Meta-analysis was then used to derive a combined OR and test for heterogeneity in the findings between studies. Results Twenty-three studies were identified. The overall meta-analysis revealed an increase in the risk of asthma in children delivered by Caesarean section (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.14, 1.29). However, in this analysis, there was evidence of heterogeneity (I2=46%) that was statistically significant (P<0.001). Restricting the analysis to childhood studies, this heterogeneity was markedly decreased (I2=32%) and no longer attained statistical significance (P=0.08). In these studies, there was also evidence of an increase (P<0.001) in the risk of asthma after Caesarean section (OR=1.20, 95% CI 1.14, 12.6). Conclusion In this meta-analysis, we found a 20% increase in the subsequent risk of asthma in children who had been delivered by Caesarean section."
1,Linking metacommunity theory and symbiont evolutionary ecology,"Processes that occur both within and between hosts can influence the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of symbionts, a broad term that includes parasitic and disease-causing organisms. Metacommunity theory can integrate these local- and regional-scale dynamics to explore symbiont community composition patterns across space. In this article I emphasize that symbionts should be incorporated into the metacommunity concept. I highlight the utility of metacommunity theory by discussing practical and general benefits that emerge from considering symbionts in a metacommunity framework. Specifically, investigating the local and regional drivers of symbiont community and metacommunity structure will lead to a more holistic understanding of symbiont ecology and evolution and could reveal novel insights into the roles of symbiont communities in mediating host health."
1,"Environmental biodiversity, human microbiota, and allergy are interrelated","Rapidly declining biodiversity may be a contributing factor to another global megatrend—the rapidly increasing prevalence of allergies and other chronic inflammatory diseases among urban populations worldwide. According to the “biodiversity hypothesis,” reduced contact of people with natural environmental features and biodiversity may adversely affect the human commensal microbiota and its immunomodulatory capacity. Analyzing atopic sensitization (i.e., allergic disposition) in a random sample of adolescents living in a heterogeneous region of 100 × 150 km, we show that environmental biodiversity in the surroundings of the study subjects’ homes influenced the composition of the bacterial classes on their skin. Compared with healthy individuals, atopic individuals had lower environmental biodiversity in the surroundings of their homes and significantly lower generic diversity of gammaproteobacteria on their skin. The functional role of the Gram-negative gammaproteobacteria is supported by in vitro measurements of expression of IL-10, a key anti-inflammatory cytokine in immunologic tolerance, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In healthy, but not in atopic, individuals, IL-10 expression was positively correlated with the abundance of the gammaproteobacterial genus Acinetobacter on the skin. These results raise fundamental questions about the consequences of biodiversity loss for both allergic conditions and public health in general."
2,Analysis of the causes of moral injury in the outbreak of 2019-nCoV.,"The infection of the novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China in December 2019 converted rapidly into a pandemic by March 11, 2020. Whereas the infection mortality rate is not completely understood, it seems to be significantly beyond that of other recent pandemics (e.g., H1N1 pandemic). This paper discusses moral injury in the context of disaster and epidemic and how easily the moral psychology of individuals and society can be shaken. Moral injury is a multiscientific concept involving psychology, culture, and religion. Amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, immoral behaviors and events such as violence, injury, and illness have also caused different degrees of impact on the moral standards of individuals, confusing moral cognition, destroying moral emotion, and weakening moral toughness, resulting in varying degrees of moral injury. If there is no national health, there will be no positive society for all. Based on this, the public needs to pay close attention to the moral health of the whole people and effectively avoid the occurrence of moral injury.

3,"Toward a Biopsychosocial Ecology of the Human Microbiome, Brain-Gut Axis, and Health","Objective: Rapidly expanding insights into the human microbiome and health suggest that Western medicine is poised for significant evolution, or perhaps revolution—this while medicine continues on a trajectory from reductionism to a biopsychosocial (BPS) paradigm recognizing biological, psychological, and social influences on health. The apparent sensitivity of the microbiota to perturbations across BPS domains suggests that a broad and inclusive framework is needed to develop applicable knowledge in this emerging area. We outline an ecological framework of the human microbiome by extending the BPS concept to better incorporate environmental and human factors as members of a global, dynamic set of systems that interact over time. Methods: We conducted a selective literature review across disciplines to integrate microbiome research into a BPS framework. Results: The microbiome can be understood in terms of ecological systems encompassing BPS domains at four levels: (a) immediate (molecular, genetic, and neural processes), (b) proximal (physiology, emotion, social integration), (c) intermediate (built environments, behaviors, societal practices), and (d) distal (physical environments, attitudes, and broad cultural, economic, and political factors). The microbiota and host are thus understood in terms of their immediate interactions and the more distal physical and social arenas in which they participate. Conclusions: A BPS ecological paradigm encourages replicable, generalizable, and interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary research and practices that take into account the vast influences on the human microbiome that may otherwise be overlooked or understood out of context. It also underscores the importance of sustainable bioenvironmental, psychological, and social systems that broadly support microbial, neural, and general health."
2,Facing the sublime: Physiological correlates of the relationship between fear and the sublime.,"The sublime is an enduring concept in Western aesthetic discourse and is often portrayed such as in Edmund Burke’s A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful of 1759 as a delightful horror, a kind of enjoyment based on negative emotions. In the current article, the relationship between sublimity and fear was explored using behavioral and physiological measures. In 2 studies (total N ≈ 120), photographs of nature were selected (Study 1: 192 photographs and Study 2: 72 photographs), rated on sublimity, beauty, fear, happiness, and arousal, before being assessed against facial muscle movement (fEMG) and skin conductance (SCR). In line with philosophical theories, ratings of sublimity showed positive associations with subjective fear ratings in both studies. Looking at fEMG data (Study 2), sublimity was in fact associated with a decrease of corrugator supercilli (frowning) reactions, indicating reduced emotional negativity. Furthermore, sublimity did not change activation levels of the zygomaticus major (smiling/positive emotional valence), nor did it influence movements of the medial frontalis (inner brow raise/fear). Increased ratings of fear increased corrugator supercilii and medial frontalis activations, and decreased zygomaticus major activation, replicating past findings. SCR activation was not predicted by any variable. The discrepancy between behavioral and physiological results likely results from a combination of false appraisal and distancing mechanisms, and thus encourages the reconsideration of generalizations made over the sublime in its relation to fear.

3,Suicidal ideation and its correlates in prisoners: A comparative study in China.,"Background: Suicide is one of the leading causes of prisoners’ death, and, as a group, inmates have higher suicide rates than their community counterparts. However, the prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese inmates and their risks of suicide remain unknown. Aims: This study investigates the prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese incarcerated populations and its risk and protective factors. Methods: We randomly selected three types of prisoners (N = 690) and a sample of college students (n = 248) from four correction facilities and a police academy in China. A self-report questionnaire with standardized scales translated from the West was administered to the samples. Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese inmates is similar to that found among inmates in the West. The correlates of suicidal ideation for the Chinese inmates are also in line with what has been found in general populations. Conclusions: It is suggested that Chinese inmates have the same risk factors and protective factors for suicidal ideation as the general population in China. Suicide prevention in Chinese prisons can learn from and inform suicide prevention work for the general population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"

3,"Suicide and attempted suicide in Jhenaidah District, Bangladesh, 2010–2018.","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported online in Crisis: The Journal of Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention on Dec 20 2019 (see record 2019-80956-001). In the original article there were errors in the affiliations of the authors. The correct affiliations for the authors are indicated in the erratum.] Background: Suicide and attempted suicide are a serious but under-explored public health problem in Bangladesh. Survey estimates suggest that Jhenaidah District, one of the 64 districts that make up Bangladesh, is one of the highest suicide-prone regions in Bangladesh. Relatively little is known about the magnitude of suicide attempts in the district. Aims: This article describes the incidence of suicide and suicide attempts for Jhenaidah, Bangladesh for the period 2010–2018. Method: Primary descriptive analysis was performed on routine data collected by a Bangladesh-based nongovernment organization (NGO): Societies for Voluntary Activities (SOVA). Results: A total of 22,675 suicide attempts and 3,152 suicides occurred in the district. The rate of suicide attempts was found to be 136.35/100,000 and the suicide rate was found to be 20.6/100,000 in Jhenaidah. The subdistrict Sadar had the highest incidence of suicide attempt (38.09%) and suicide (33.47%). Poisoning was the most common method of suicide attempt for both males (77.07%) and females (77%). Limitations: Many cases of suicide attempts and suicide are unreported in Bangladesh owing to stigmatization; only reported cases form part of this investigation. Conclusion: Jhenaidah has very high rates of suicide and suicide attempts that surpass the global and Bangladesh averages. Although females demonstrate higher suicide rates, male suicide rates have gradually increased over the study period. Future studies are called for to better understand the local patterns and dynamics of fatal and nonfatal suicidal behaviors. Developing a sub-district-, district-, and national-level suicide prevention strategy ought to be considered a priority. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,"Theater majors compared with nonmajors: Investigating temperament and emotion beliefs, awareness, regulation, and perception.","Given how central emotions are to the field of acting, surprisingly little research has examined how actors’ emotional tendencies and skills vary from other individuals. In a sample of 284 college students, we investigated how theater majors differed from other students who have limited or no experience with acting. We expected that theater majors would be more temperamentally emotional, have more positive attitudes about emotions, have better awareness and understanding of their own emotions, and be more skilled at regulating and identifying emotions. Results indicated that theater majors (compared with those with no acting experience or those with some experience) reported higher temperamental sadness and fear, more positive views toward anger and sadness, greater awareness of their own emotions, and greater ability to amplify their emotions. Theater majors more accurately identified pride expressions than nonactors, but students in the no-acting group more accurately identified anger expressions than those with some acting experience and theater majors. Overall, this study advances current understanding of how actors differ emotionally from other individuals and provides new insight into variations in temperament, emotional beliefs, and regulatory and perceptual skills.

2,Applying experimental therapeutics to examine cognitive and chronological vulnerabilities as mediators of acute outcomes in cognitive-behavioral therapy and light therapy for winter depression.,"Objective: We applied the experimental therapeutics approach to test whether acute treatment outcomes for winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD) are mediated by a cognitive mechanism in cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT-SAD) versus a chronobiologic mechanism in light therapy (LT). Method: Currently depressed adults with major depression, recurrent with seasonal pattern (N = 177; 83.6% female, 92.1% non-Hispanic White, M age = 45.6) were randomized to 6 weeks of LT or group CBT-SAD. SAD symptoms were assessed weekly on the Structured Clinical Interview for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression–SAD Version. At pre-, mid-, and posttreatment, participants completed measures of general depressogenic cognitions (Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale; DAS); SAD-specific negative cognitions (Seasonal Beliefs Questionnaire; SBQ); chronotype (Morningness–Eveningness Questionnaire; MEQ); and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory–Second Edition). Results: Parallel-process growth models showed evidence for hypothesized mechanisms. For SAD-specific negative cognitions (SBQ), both symptom measures showed (1) an effect of treatment group on the slope of the mediator, with CBT-SAD demonstrating greater decreases, and (2) an effect of the slope of the mediator on the slope of the outcome. These effects held for the SBQ but not the broader measure of depressogenic cognitions (DAS). For the chronotype measure (MEQ), treatment assignment affected change, whereby LT was associated with reduced “eveningness,” but this was unrelated to change in symptoms. Conclusions: CBT-SAD promoted decreases in SAD-specific negative cognitions, and these changes were related to decreases in symptoms. Consistent with the theory that LT corrects misaligned circadian rhythms, LT reduced eveningness, but this did not correspond to symptom improvement.

2,The effect of the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic on college students in Wuhan.,"Objective: This study explored a multiple mediation model in Wuhan’s college students. Positive thinking and resilience were identified as mediators between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) victimization experiences and mental health. Method: The sample included 384 from 4 universities in Wuhan, China. Four structured instruments were applied to the college students, including scale of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus victimization experience, scale of the positive thinking, scale of the resilience, and scale of the mental health. The responses were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Structural equation models were used to construct measurement and structural models. Results: The findings confirmed that the 2019-nCoV victimization experience was a negative predictor of mental health; positive thinking and resilience were strong mediators between 2019-nCoV victimization experience and mental health. Conclusions: The results indicated that a complete model was significant because positive thinking compensated for resilience. Notably, these 2 strong mediators will vastly resist the negative influences of 2019-nCoV victimization experience on mental health in Wuhan’s college students until the end of the pandemic.

1,Impacts of Biodiversity Loss Escalate Through Time as Redundancy Fades,"Plant diversity generally promotes biomass production, but how the shape of the response curve changes with time remains unclear. This is a critical knowledge gap because the shape of this relationship indicates the extent to which loss of the first few species will influence biomass production. Using two long-term (≥13 years) biodiversity experiments, we show that the effects of diversity on biomass productivity increased and became less saturating over time. Our analyses suggest that effects of diversity-dependent ecosystem feedbacks and interspecific complementarity accumulate over time, causing high-diversity species combinations that appeared functionally redundant during early years to become more functionally unique through time. Consequently, simplification of diverse ecosystems will likely have greater negative impacts on ecosystem functioning than has been suggested by short-term experiments. \ Long-term grassland experiments show that high-diversity species combinations become more functionally diverse with time. \ Long-term grassland experiments show that high-diversity species combinations become more functionally diverse with time."

2,"Gut to Brain Dysbiosis: Mechanisms Linking Western Diet Consumption, the Microbiome, and Cognitive Impairment","Consumption of a Western Diet (WD) that is high in saturated fat and added sugars negatively impacts cognitive function, particularly mnemonic processes that rely on the integrity of the hippocampus. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiome influences cognitive function via the gut-brain axis, and that WD factors significantly alter the proportions of commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. Here we review mechanisms through which consuming a WD negatively impacts neurocognitive function, with a particular focus on recent evidence linking the gut microbiome with dietary- and metabolic-associated hippocampal impairment. We highlight evidence linking gut bacteria to altered intestinal permeability and blood brain barrier integrity, thus making the brain more vulnerable to the influx of deleterious substances from the circulation. WD consumption also increases production of endotoxin by commensal bacteria, which may promote neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction. Recent findings also show that diet-induced alterations in gut microbiota impair peripheral insulin sensitivity, which is associated with hippocampal neuronal derrangements and associated mnemonic deficits. In some cases treatment with specific probiotics or prebiotics can prevent or reverse some of the deleterious impact of WD consumption on neuropsychological outcomes, indicating that targeting the microbiome may be a successful strategy for combating dietary- and metabolic-associated cognitive impairment."

Tolstoy's (1868/2005) War and Peace and Luke Fildes's painting 'The Doctor.' People confronting illness, like generals as depicted by Tolstoy, are never in control of events, yet they must take responsibility. The physician in Fildes's painting cannot control the course of his patient's disease, but he can, through the closest attention, perhaps deflect that course. The moral dilemma of humans, both healers and ill people, is to be both out of control and ultimately responsible. What we are most responsible for is sustaining generosity. The beginnings of generous medicine are some simple questions, with which the essay concludes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,"Family and friend social support as mediators of adolescent sibling victimization and mental health, self-esteem, and delinquency.","Sibling victimization is associated with adjustment problems. Protective factors that reduce the detrimental effects of sibling victimization are unknown. We examined the mediating role of social support from family and friends in the relationship between sibling victimization and adolescents’ mental health distress, self-esteem, and delinquency. A telephone survey (N = 850; 49% female) was conducted with a nationally representative sample of United States adolescents (Aged 10 to 17). Three mediation models were tested exploring (a) the unique effects of family and friend support, (b) the relative effects of each type of support, and (c) the effects of total support (family and friend support summed). The three models demonstrated partial mediation of adolescents’ mental health and self-esteem. Family and total support, but not friend support, partially mediated the relationship between sibling victimization and delinquency. Findings showed that family and friend social support, in combination and sometimes uniquely, reduced the adverse effects sibling victimization associated with adolescents’ mental health, self-esteem, and delinquency. Efforts aimed at promoting social support from family and friends as protective factors may reduce the risk of sibling victimization experiences for adolescent well-being difficulties.

2,"Maternal comforting behavior, toddlers’ dysregulated fear, and toddlers’ emotion regulatory behaviors.","Developmental theories of emotion regulation suggest that influences from both extrinsic (e.g., from caregivers) and intrinsic (i.e., temperament) sources contribute to children’s displays of emotion regulatory behaviors. Very few studies have examined specific caregiver behaviors in relation to specific regulatory behaviors. Further, few empirical investigations have tested theoretical notions that temperament may be an important context in which to understand the nature of the relation between caregiver behavior and toddlers’ regulatory behaviors. The current study examined the specific maternal behavior of physical comfort in relation to three regulatory strategies exhibited by toddlers (attention-shifting, caregiver-focused behavior, and self-focused behavior) in 117 pairs of mothers and their 24-month-old toddlers. Further, we tested the temperament dimension of dysregulated fear, a more recent derivation of behavioral inhibition, both in relation to regulatory efforts and as a moderator of relations between maternal comforting and toddler regulatory behaviors. Dysregulated fear related directly and positively to attention-shifting, and it moderated the relation between maternal comforting and both caregiver-focused and self-focused behaviors. This study provides new evidence of the importance of both extrinsic and intrinsic correlates of emotion regulation in early childhood. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,Rising youth suicide and the changing cultural context in South Korea.,"Background: South Korean society faces a serious challenge in the increasing rates of youth suicidal behavior. There is a need both to gain a better understanding of the causes of this behavior and to develop strategies for responding to this critical public health issue. Aims: This article analyzes how psychological, sociopsychological, and subcultural factors influence suicidal proneness among Korean youth as well as makes suggestions for developing social policies that could reduce Korean youth suicidal behaviors. Method: Correlation and multivariate regression analyses on suicide proneness and depression were employed using a sample of 172 South Korean youths (aged 18–24) selected from the 2009 General Social Survey collected through face-to-face interviews. Results: Young people’s suicidal proneness is associated with depression, a tolerant attitude toward suicide, strained family relations, living in rural areas, being female, and being closely related to survivors of suicide or potential suicides. Conclusion: The findings from this study reveal the significance of social and cultural factors as influences on recent youth suicidal behavior in Korea. The analysis suggests that the underlying risk factors of suicidal behavior are embedded in the changing social and cultural context of Korean society. Thus, suicide prevention efforts should involve more than merely treating any underlying psychiatric disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

2,How do children learn novel emotion words? A study of emotion concept acquisition in preschoolers.,"Understanding emotion words is vital to understanding, regulating, and communicating one’s emotions. Yet, little work examines how emotion words are acquired by children. Previous research in linguistics suggests that children use the sentence frame in which a novel word is presented to home in on the meaning of that word, in conjunction with situational cues from the environment. No research has examined how children integrate these cues to learn the meaning of emotion adjectives (e.g., “happy,” “sad,” “mad”). We conducted 2 studies examining the role of sentence frame and situational context in children’s (ages 3–5) understanding of the meanings of novel words denoting emotions. In Study 1 (N = 135) children viewed a conversation wherein a novel “alien” word was presented in 1 of 3 sentence frames that varied in how likely the word was to denote an emotion (i.e., is daxy, feels daxy, or feels daxy about). Children selected the image that represented the meaning of the word in a picture-pointing task. Images depicted aliens experiencing an emotion, a physical state, or performing an action. In Study 2 (N = 113) situational context was added via cartoons depicting an emotional scenario. Findings suggest that children are more likely to associate emotion images with a novel word with increasing age, more informative sentence frames, and when the situational context implies that an emotion is present. This provides important insight on how educational and clinical settings can use language and situational context to aide in emotion understanding.

3,Proximal predictors of gun violence among adolescent males involved in crime.,"The growing public health and legal concerns regarding gun violence has led to a call for research that investigates risk factors for gun violence across a variety of domains. Individual and sociocontextual risk factors have been associated with violence more broadly, and in some instances gun-carrying, however no prior research has investigated the role of these factors in explaining gun violence using longitudinal data. The current study utilized a subsample (N = 161) from the Pathways to Desistance Study, which is a longitudinal sample of serious adolescent offenders to evaluate interindividual and intraindividual differences in relevant risk factors of gun violence. Results suggest that there are a few key proximal individual-level and sociocontextual predictors for gun violence, including witnessing nongun violence, future orientation, and perceived personal rewards to crime. Findings demonstrate the salience of exposure to violence in contributing to gun violence and identify levers of action for public policy.

2,Theory-specific patient change processes and mechanisms in different cognitive therapies for depression.,"Objective: This study aimed to identify differential patient change processes and mechanisms associated with long-term outcome in exposure-based cognitive therapy (EBCT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression. Method: We drew on a randomized controlled trial in which 149 patients were randomly assigned to either EBCT or CBT, with the treatments showing comparable efficacy at 12-month follow-up (grosse Holtforth et al., 2019). Based on Doss’s (2004) 4-step model of psychotherapy change and using sequential multilevel structural equation models, we tested putative theory-based change processes and mechanisms for both treatments. Specifically, we examined emotional processing and cognitive restructuring during treatment as hypothesized change processes of EBCT and CBT, respectively. Furthermore, as potential change mechanisms during follow-up, we examined theory-relevant mechanisms for each treatment, preselected via multilevel models. Results: Although the full serial mediational pathways were not supported, EBCT fostered greater during-treatment increases in emotional processing and higher self-efficacy during follow-up than CBT, both of which associated with better long-term depression outcome. Unexpectedly, cognitive restructuring change did not differ between EBCT and CBT. Across both CBT and EBCT, greater during-treatment increases in cognitive restructuring related to lower cognitive-behavioral avoidance and greater self-efficacy across follow-up, which associated with lower long-term depression. Conclusions: Results suggest that therapists might improve long-term depression outcome by fostering both emotional processing (via emotion-focused techniques as included in EBCT) and cognitive restructuring (by using general CBT techniques included in both treatments), which operate either directly or through varied treatment-common mechanisms (e.g., greater self-efficacy and reduced cognitive-behavioral avoidance).

3,Organizational change and the chief diversity officer: A case study of institutionalizing a diversity plan.,"Organizational change around diversity and inclusion does not occur rapidly in higher education. As institutions strive to deliver on their espoused goals, values, and mission to reflect the social and cultural demographics representative of the state, society, and world, many argue the importance of strategic diversity plans. While recruitment and retention initiatives for faculty, staff, and students remain a priority for institutions, it is becoming increasingly evident, particularly for the public good and sustainability, that diversity plans evidence progress and success. The chief diversity officer often leads these organizational change efforts. This paper is a case study of a public research-intensive university’s successes and challenges with institutionalization of a diversity plan, including implications for effecting change in the campus organizational culture.

3,Effects of Stress on Commensal Microbes and Immune System Activity,"The body harbors a vast array of microbes that are collectively known as the microbiota. Increasing attention is being paid to the role of the gut microbiota in the health of the host. Gut microbial communities are relatively resistant to change, though alterations in homeostasis can also significantly change gut microbial community structure. An important factor that has been demonstrated to alter the composition of the gut microbiota is exposure to psychological stressors. And, evidence indicates that the commensal microbiota are involved in stressor-induced immunomodulation. This chapter will discuss the impact of psychosocial stress on immunity, and present evidence that stressor-induced alterations in the composition of gut microbial communities contributes to stressor-induced immunomodulation and neurobiological sequelae. Finally, the role of the microbiota in the perinatal time period will be explored, and an integrative hypothesis of the role of the microbiome in health and stress response will be proposed.;"
2,Gut microbiome and bone,"The gut microbiome is now viewed as a tissue that interacts bidirectionally with the gastrointestinal, immune, endocrine and nervous systems, affecting the cellular responses in numerous organs. Evidence is accumulating of gut microbiome involvement in a growing number of pathophysiological processes, many of which are linked to inflammatory responses. More specifically, data acquired over the last decade point to effects of the gut microbiome on bone mass regulation and on the development of bone diseases (such as osteoporosis) and of inflammatory joint diseases characterized by bone loss. Mice lacking a gut microbiome have bone mass alteration that can be reversed by gut recolonization. Changes in the gut microbiome composition have been reported in mice with estrogen-deficiency osteoporosis and have also been found in a few studies in humans. Probiotic therapy decreases bone loss in estrogen-deficient animals. The effect of the gut microbiome on bone tissue involves complex mechanisms including modulation of CD4+T cell activation, control of osteoclastogenic cytokine production and modifications in hormone levels. This complexity may contribute to explain the discrepancies observed betwwen some studies whose results vary depending on the age, gender, genetic background and treatment duration. Further elucidation of the mechanisms involved is needed. However, the available data hold promise that gut microbiome manipulation may prove of interest in the management of bone diseases."
1,Planned Out-of-Hospital Birth and Birth Outcomes,"Background \ The frequency of planned out-of-hospital birth in the United States has increased in recent years. The value of studies assessing the perinatal risks of planned out-of-hospital birth versus hospital birth has been limited by cases in which transfer to a hospital is required and a birth that was initially planned as an out-of-hospital birth is misclassified as a hospital birth. \  \ Methods \ We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all births that occurred in Oregon during 2012 and 2013 using data from newly revised Oregon birth certificates that allowed for the disaggregation of hospital births into the categories of planned in-hospital births and planned out-of-hospital births that took place in the hospital after a woman’s intrapartum transfer to the hospital. We assessed perinatal morbidity and mortality, maternal morbidity, and obstetrical procedures according to the planned birth setting (out of hospital vs. hospital). \  \ Results \ Planned out-of-hospital birth was associated with a higher rate of perinatal death than was planned in-hospital birth (3.9 vs. 1.8 deaths per 1000 deliveries, P = 0.003; odds ratio after adjustment for maternal characteristics and medical conditions, 2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 4.30; adjusted risk difference, 1.52 deaths per 1000 births; 95% CI, 0.51 to 2.54). The odds for neonatal seizure were higher and the odds for admission to a neonatal intensive care unit lower with planned out-of-hospital births than with planned in-hospital birth. Planned out-of-hospital birth was also strongly associated with unassisted vaginal delivery (93.8%, vs. 71.9% with planned in-hospital births; P<0.001) and with decreased odds for obstetrical procedures. \  \ Conclusions \ Perinatal mortality was higher with planned out-of-hospital birth than with planned in-hospital birth, but the absolute risk of death was low in both settings.

3,Voluntary arousing negative experiences (VANE): Why we like to be scared.,"This study examined survey data and neural reactivity associated with voluntarily engaging in high arousal negative experiences (VANE). Here we suggest how otherwise negative stimuli might be experienced as positive in the context of voluntary engagement. Participants were recruited from customers who had already purchased tickets to attend an “extreme” haunted attraction. Survey data measuring self-report affect, expectations, and experience was collected from 262 adults (139 women and 123 men; age M = 27.5 years, SD = 9.3 years) before and after their experience. Changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) indices of reactivity to cognitive and emotional tasks were further assessed from a subsample of 100 participants. Results suggested that participants’ reported affect improved, particularly for those that reported feeling tired, bored, or stressed prior to the experience. Among those whose moods improved, neural reactivity decreased in response to multiple tasks. Together, these data suggest that VANE reduces neural reactivity following stress. This result could explain post-VANE euphoria and may be adaptive in that it could help individuals to cope with subsequent stressors. To the extent that this phenomenon replicates in clinical situations, it could inform clinical interventions by using VANE principles to reduce neural reactivity to subsequent stressors.

3,Discrepant feeling rules and unscripted emotion work: Women coping with termination for fetal anomaly.,"The sociology of emotion is rapidly evolving and has implications for medical settings. Advancing medical technologies create new contexts for decision-making and emotional reaction that are framed by “feeling rules.” Feeling rules guide not only behavior, but also how one believes one should feel, thereby causing one to attempt to bring one’s authentic feelings into line with perceived feeling rules. Using qualitative data, the theoretical existence of feeling rules in pregnancy and prenatal testing is confirmed. Further examination extends this analysis: at times of technological development feeling rules are often discrepant, leaving patients with unscripted emotion work. Data from a study of women who interrupted anomalous pregnancies indicate that feeling rules are unclear when competing feeling rules are operating during times of societal and technological change. Because much of this occurs below the level of consciousness, medical and psychological services providers need to be aware of potential discrepancies in feeling rules and assist patients in identifying the salient feeling rules. Patients’ struggles ease when they can recognize the discrepancies and assess their implications for decision-making and emotional response.

1,Gut microbiome and cancer immunotherapy,"Microbiome is becoming crucial in that the balance between human health and disease can be mediated by the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome can modulate the host immune system both locally and systemically. Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising way in the treatment of patients with cancer. Accumulating evidence supports that microbiome affects the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors. Here, we discuss the mutual relationship among gut microbiome, cancer, immunity, and cancer immunotherapy, with a focus on immunotherapy. Also, we briefly introduce the relevant challenges that affect the therapeutic efficacy and present the possible solutions."
3,Psychopathy and violence: Does antisocial cognition mediate the relationship between the PCL: YV factor scores and violent offending?,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether proactive and reactive antisocial cognition mediate the effect of Factors 1 (core personality features) and 2 (behavioral deviance) of the Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL: YV; Forth, Kosson, & Hare, 2003) on violent offending. In this study Bandura et al.’s (1996) Moral Disengagement (MD) scale and the Impulse Control (IC) scale of the Weinberger Adjustment Inventory (WAI; Weinberger & Schwartz, 1990) served as proxies for proactive and reactive antisocial cognition, respectively. It was hypothesized that proactive antisocial cognition (MD) would mediate the Factor 1–violence relationship and that both proactive antisocial cognition and reactive antisocial cognition (IC) would mediate the Factor 2–violence relationship. A 3-wave path analysis of data from 1,354 adjudicated delinquents produced results consistent with the first part of the hypothesis (i.e., proactive antisocial mediation of the Factor 1–violence relationship) but inconsistent with the second part of the hypothesis (i.e., only proactive antisocial cognition mediated the Factor 2–violence relationship). Whereas the direct path from Factor 1 to violent offending was no longer significant when MD and IC were taken into account, the direct path from Factor 2 to violent offender remained significant even after MD and IC were included as mediators. This suggests that whereas proactive antisocial cognition plays a major role in mediating the Factor 1–violence relationship, the Factor 2–violence relationship is mediated by proactive antisocial cognition and variables not included or not adequately covered in the current study.

2,The perils of practicum in the time of COVID-19: A graduate student’s perspective.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has placed competing demands on many graduate students working at practica. Though graduate programs seek to minimize potential sources of exposure to the virus, some practicum sites rely on students as essential staff. At the same time, although some students may wish to eliminate this source of potential exposure to the virus, other students may consider the opportunity to fulfill their practicum duties at a time of crisis an important part of their educational experience. Guidance published by the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers regarding internship students provides at least a starting point for programs to develop policies that allow students to make informed decisions about their practicum training.

2,Investigation of the cortical activity during episodic future thinking in schizophrenia: A functional near-infrared spectroscopy study.,"Episodic future thinking (EFT) refers to mental simulation of possible future events, a process that mostly depends on episodic memory (EM). EFT impairment in schizophrenia was proposed to disturb continuity in self-functioning. Schizophrenia patients are also impaired in EM as well as executive functions (EFs). In the present study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between EFT and memory functions in schizophrenia by assessing (a) whether a group of individuals with schizophrenia (schizophrenia group [SG]) who have relatively intact long-term memory functions differ from healthy controls (control group [CG]) in terms of EFT performance, and (b) whether such difference is biologically represented in terms of cortical activity. We also aimed to clarify the role of EFs in EFT in 3 task conditions: past remembering with a single cue (PR), future imagination with a single cue (FI-1C), and future imagination with 3 given cues (FI-3C). Cortical activity was monitored by functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Although the two groups showed a comparable performance in the PR, the SG performed worse than the CG in the two future-imagination conditions. In the CG, mental flexibility predicted EFT, and EM predicted PR. No such relationship was observed in the SG. In the CG only, activity was higher in the FI-1C than the PR in the middle and superior temporal cortices. In the SG, activity in the rostral prefrontal cortex (rPFC) was negatively correlated with performance in FI-3C. These results suggest that EFT is still observed but not associated with EFs in individuals with schizophrenia having relatively intact memory functions. Altered activity in the rPFC may be associated with EFT impairment in schizophrenia. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,Airway microbiome is associated with respiratory functions and responses to ambient particulate matter exposure,"Background \ Ambient particulate matter (PM) exposure has been associated with respiratory function decline in epidemiological studies. We hypothesize that a possible underlying mechanism is the perturbation of airway microbiome by PM exposure. \ Methods \ During October 2016–October 2017, on two human cohorts (n = 115 in total) in Shanghai China, we systematically collected three categories of data: (1) respiratory functions, (2) airway microbiome from sputum, and (3) PM2.5 (PM of ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter) level in ambient air. We investigated the impact of PM2.5 on airway microbiome as well as the link between airway microbiome and respiratory functions using linear mixed regression models. \ Results \ The respiratory function of our primary interest includes forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1st second (FEV1). FEV1/FVC, an important respiratory function trait and key diagnosis criterion of COPD, was significantly associated with airway bacteria load (p = 0.0038); and FEV1 was associated with airway microbiome profile (p = 0.013). Further, airway microbiome was significantly influenced by PM2.5 exposure (p = 4.48E-11). \ Conclusions \ To our knowledge, for the first time, we demonstrated the impact of PM2.5 on airway microbiome, and reported the link between airway microbiome and respiratory functions. The results expand our understanding on the scope of PM2.5 exposure's influence on human respiratory system, and point to novel etiological mechanism of PM2.5 exposure induced diseases."
1,Prevention of surgical site infection via antibiotic administration according to guidelines after gynecological surgery,"Aim We modified the antimicrobial prophylaxis of surgical site infection (SSI) according to the guidelines of the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and Japan Society of Infectious Diseases (hereinafter referred to as optimization) and measured outcomes. Methods From April 2016 to March 2017, we performed cesarean section and open hysterectomy with optimization, and compared the outcome to that of surgery performed without optimization between April 2014 and March 2016. We measured the rates of antibiotic discontinuation, appropriate antibiotic selection, SSI incidence, resumption of antibiotic therapy and fever incidence, as well as the length of postoperative hospital stay and medical expenses for antibiotics to evaluate the appropriateness and outcomes of antibiotic prophylaxis. Results Optimization resulted in a change in the method of selecting antibiotics for cesarean section, but there was no change in SSI incidence rate (0.74% vs 0.0%, P = 0.36). Optimization reduced the use of antibiotics and medical expenses of hysterectomy (median reduction of 50% and 78% for hysterectomy without or with lymphadenectomy, respectively). However, there was no change in outcome regarding SSI incidence (5.7% vs 0.0%, P = 0.11 and 7.8% vs 9.5%, P = 0.77, respectively). Conclusion Appropriate use of antibiotics according to guidelines reduced antibiotic dose and medical expenses, but there was no change in outcome regarding SSI incidence rate. These findings suggested that implementation of dosing regimens according to the guidelines would be useful to reduce antibiotic medicine costs and prevent resistant bacteria and complications associated with antibiotics."
2,The Microbiome Stress Project: Toward a Global Meta-Analysis of Environmental Stressors and Their Effects on Microbial Communities,"Microbial community structure is highly sensitive to natural (e.g. drought, temperature, fire) and anthropogenic (e.g. heavy metal exposure, land-use change) stressors. However, despite an immense amount of data generated, systematic, cross-environment analyses of microbiome responses to multiple disturbances are lacking. Here, we present the Microbiome Stress Project, an open-access database of environmental and host-associated 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing studies collected to facilitate cross-study analyses of microbiome responses to stressors. This database will comprise published and unpublished datasets re-processed from the raw sequences into exact sequence variants using our standardized computational pipeline. Our database will provide insight into general response patterns of microbiome diversity, structure, and stability to environmental stressors. It will also enable the identification of cross-study associations between single or multiple stressors and specific microbial clades. Here, we present a proof-of-concept meta-analysis of 606 microbiomes (from nine studies) to assess microbial community responses to: (1) one stressor in one environment: soil warming across a variety of soil types, (2) a range of stressors in one environment: soil microbiome responses to a comprehensive set of stressors (incl. temperature, diesel, antibiotics, land use change, drought, and heavy metals), (3) one stressor across a range of environments: copper exposure effects on soil, sediment, activated-sludge reactors, and gut environments, and (4) the general trends of microbiome stressor responses. Overall, we found that stressor exposure significantly decreases microbiome alpha diversity and increases beta diversity (community dispersion) across a range of environments and stressor types. We observed a hump-shaped relationship between microbial community resistance to stressors (i.e. the average pairwise similarity score between the control and stressed communities) and alpha diversity. We used Phylofactor to identify microbial clades and individual taxa as potential bioindicators of copper contamination across different environments. Using standardized computational and statistical methods, the Microbiome Stress Project will leverage thousands of existing datasets to build a general framework for how microbial communities respond to environmental stress."
2,Self-determination theory interventions for health behavior change: Meta-analysis and meta-analytic structural equation modeling of randomized controlled trials.,"Objective: We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to promote health behavior change based on self-determination theory (SDT). The review aimed to (a) quantify the impact of SDT interventions on health behaviors, (b) test mediation by theoretically specified variables (autonomous motivation and perceived competence), and (c) identify moderators of intervention effectiveness. Method: Computerized searches and additional strategies identified 56 articles that yielded 65 independent tests of SDT interventions. Random effects meta-analysis and metaregressions were conducted via STATA; meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) was used to test mediation. Results: The sample-weighted average effect size for SDT interventions was d+ = .23, and there were significant effects for physical activity, sedentary behavior, diet, alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation (.16 ≥ d+ ≥ .29). Effect sizes exhibited both publication bias and small sample bias but remained significantly different from zero, albeit of smaller magnitude, after correction for bias (d+ ≥ .15). MASEM indicated that autonomous motivation and perceived competence mediated intervention effects on behavior. Metaregression analyses indicated that features of the sample, intervention, or methodology generally did not moderate effect sizes. Conclusion: The present review indicates that SDT interventions have a significant but small effect on health behavior change and suggests several directions for future research.

2,Training set coherence and set size effects on concept generalization and recognition.,"Building conceptual knowledge that generalizes to novel situations is a key function of human memory. Category-learning paradigms have long been used to understand the mechanisms of knowledge generalization. In the present study, we tested the conditions that promote formation of new concepts. Participants underwent 1 of 6 training conditions that differed in the number of examples per category (set size) and their relative similarity to the category average (set coherence). Performance metrics included rates of category learning, ability to generalize categories to new items of varying similarity to prototypes, and recognition memory for individual examples. In categorization, high set coherence led to faster learning and better generalization, while set size had little effect. Recognition did not differ reliably among conditions. We also tested the nature of memory representations used for categorization and recognition decisions using quantitative prototype and exemplar models fit to behavioral responses. Prototype models posit abstract category representations based on the category’s central tendency, whereas exemplar models posit that categories are represented by individual category members. Prototype strategy use during categorization increased with increasing set coherence, suggesting that coherent training sets facilitate extraction of commonalities within a category. We conclude that learning from a coherent set of examples is an efficient means of forming abstract knowledge that generalizes broadly. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,Stress and the microbiota–gut–brain axis in visceral pain: Relevance to irritable bowel syndrome,"Visceral pain is a global term used to describe pain originating from the internal organs of the body, which affects a significant proportion of the population and is a common feature of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While IBS is multifactorial, with no single etiology to completely explain the disorder, many patients also experience comorbid behavioral disorders, such as anxiety or depression; thus, IBS is described as a disorder of the gut–brain axis. Stress is implicated in the development and exacerbation of visceral pain disorders. Chronic stress can modify central pain circuitry, as well as change motility and permeability throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. More recently, the role of the gut microbiota in the bidirectional communication along the gut–brain axis, and subsequent changes in behavior, has emerged. Thus, stress and the gut microbiota can interact through complementary or opposing factors to influence visceral nociceptive behaviors. This review will highlight the evidence by which stress and the gut microbiota interact in the regulation of visceral nociception. We will focus on the influence of stress on the microbiota and the mechanisms by which microbiota can affect the stress response and behavioral outcomes with an emphasis on visceral pain.

3,Associations between informal caregivers’ burden and educational level.,"We investigated the association between the education of informal caregivers’ (IC) and their physical and mental burden. We hypothesized that better-educated IC would have more resources available to manage the care situation and as a result show lower perceived burden. We conducted a population survey of 6,087 German residents aged 18+ years, 966 of whom reported to be IC. Results show that IC felt more often mentally than physically burdened. In the multivariate analyses, higher-educated IC did not have lower odds of feeling physically burdened than lower-educated IC, though they did have increased odds of feeling mentally burdened. The higher perceived mental burden of higher-educated IC may be related to fear of loss of self-fulfilment and autonomy. Support services should consider the mental burden of higher-educated IC and tailor their interventions accordingly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,Chemogenetic inhibition of dopaminergic projections to the nucleus accumbens has sexually dimorphic effects in the rat gambling task.,"Women and men can differ in their propensity to take risks and develop impulse control and addiction disorders. Sexual dimorphisms in behavioral control by the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system may underlie these phenomena, given its sensitivity to gonadal hormones. However, this is hard to test experimentally using humans. Using the rat gambling task (rGT), we investigated what impact acute inhibition of accumbal dopamine had on decision-making and impulsivity in animals of both sexes. We expressed an inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (hM4D[Gi]) in the accumbal dopaminergic efferents of female and male transgenic (Tg) rats, engineered to selectively express cre recombinase in neurons synthesizing tyrosine hydroxylase. We then trained the rats to perform the rGT and assessed the effect of an acute clozapine-n-oxide (0–3 mg/kg) challenge. Chemogenetic inhibition of dopaminergic projections to the accumbens did not affect choice in females, perhaps due to low levels of risky choice in Tg+ animals at baseline, but induced a switch from risky to optimal decision-making in males performing the cued rGT. This manipulation also decreased motor impulsivity but only in females. These data support the hypothesis that cue-driven risky choice is mediated, at least in males, by activity of accumbal dopaminergic neurons. However, motor impulsivity is more sensitive to inhibition of accumbal dopamine neurons in female rats. These data may help explain differences in the manifestation of addictions across gender and reinforce the importance of examining both sexes when seeking to attribute control of behavior to specific monoaminergic pathways.

1,The Health Advantage of a Vegan Diet: Exploring the Gut Microbiota Connection,"This review examines whether there is evidence that a strict vegan diet confers health advantages beyond that of a vegetarian diet or overall healthy eating. Few studies include vegan subjects as a distinct experimental group, yet when vegan diets are directly compared to vegetarian and omnivorous diets, a pattern of protective health benefits emerges. The relatively recent inclusion of vegan diets in studies of gut microbiota and health allows us the opportunity to assess whether the vegan gut microbiota is distinct, and whether the health advantages characteristic of a vegan diet may be partially explained by the associated microbiota profile. The relationship between diet and the intestinal microbial profile appears to follow a continuum, with vegans displaying a gut microbiota most distinct from that of omnivores, but not always significantly different from that of vegetarians. The vegan gut profile appears to be unique in several characteristics, including a reduced abundance of pathobionts and a greater abundance of protective species. Reduced levels of inflammation may be the key feature linking the vegan gut microbiota with protective health effects. However, it is still unclear whether a therapeutic vegan diet can be prescribed to alter the gut microflora for long-term health benefits."
1,A Comparison of Homogenization vs. Enzymatic Lysis for Microbiome Profiling in Clinical Endoscopic Biopsy Tissue Samples,"Identification of the human microbiome has proven to be of utmost importance with the emerging role of bacteria in various physiological and pathological processes. High throughput sequencing strategies have evolved to assess the composition of the microbiome. To identify possible bias that may exist in the processing of tissue for whole genome sequencing (WGS), it is important to evaluate the extraction method on the overall microbial content and composition. Here we compare two different methods of extraction, homogenization versus enzymatic lysis, on gastric, esophageal and colorectal biopsies and survey the microbial content and composition using WGS and quantitative PCR (qPCR). We examined total bacterial content using universal 16S rDNA qPCR as well as the abundance of three phyla (Actinobacter, Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes) and one genus (Fusobacterium). We found minimal differences between the two extraction methods in the overall community structure or in the abundance of specific clade. Furthermore, based on our qPCR analysis, neither method demonstrated preferential extraction of any particular clade of bacteria, nor significantly altered the detection of gram-positive or gram-negative organisms. However, although the overall microbial composition remained the same and the most prevalent bacteria could be detected effectively using either method, we demonstrate that the homogenization extraction method provides higher microbial DNA content and higher read counts from human tissue biopsy samples of the gastrointestinal tract."
2,Psychometric properties of the Adulthood Trauma Inventory.,"Objective: Psychological trauma is an important public health problem, but previous measurement tools have primarily focused on childhood traumatic events while trauma exposure in adulthood (>18 years of age) has received less attention. The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of an instrument for assessment of psychological trauma in adulthood, the Adulthood Trauma Inventory (ATI). Method: Participants (n = 893) completed the ATI, a 33-item questionnaire modeled after the Early Trauma Inventory-Self Report (ETI-SR), assessing traumatic events occurring after 18 years of age. Participants also completed instruments to assess depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and early trauma (ETI-SR). Internal consistency and item response theory metrics were examined. Results: ATI total score (number of items endorsed) yielded the greatest internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .77) and was significantly (p < .0001) correlated with indices of PTSD (ρ = 0.40), depression (ρ = 0.31), and early trauma (ρ = 0.56). Area under the curve and accuracy values ranged from 0.65 and 70% (depression) to 0.75 and 95% (current PTSD). Conclusions: The ATI is a valid measure of adult psychological trauma that may be useful for both clinical assessment and research involving the long-term effects on the individual and psychobiology.

3,Social network analysis of child and adult interorganizational connections.,"Objective: Because most programs serve either children and their families or adults, a critical component of service and treatment continuity in mental health and related services for individuals transitioning into adulthood (ages 14-25) is coordination across programs on either side of the adult age divide. Methods: This study was conducted in Clark County, Washington, a community that had received a Partnership for Youth Transition grant from the Federal Center for Mental Health Services. Social Network Analysis methodology was used to describe the strength and direction of each organization's relationship to other organizations in the transition network. Interviews were conducted before grant implementation (n = 103) and again four years later (n = 99). Results: The findings of the study revealed significant changes in the nature of relationships between organizations over time. While the overall density of the transition service network remained stable, specific ways of connecting did change. Some activities became more decentralized while others became more inclusive as evidenced by the increase in size of the largest K-core. This was particularly true for the activity of 'receiving referrals.' These changes reflected more direct contact between child and adult serving organizations. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The two separate child and adult systems identified at baseline appeared more integrated by the end of the grant period. Having greater connectivity among all organizations regardless of ages served should benefit youth and young adults of transition age. This study provides further evidence that Social Network Analysis is a useful method for measuring change in service system integration over time.

2,A role for neurogenesis in probabilistic reward learning.,"Rewards are often unreliable and optimal choice requires behavioral flexibility and learning about the probabilistic nature of uncertain rewards. Probabilistic learning occurs over multiple trials, often without conscious knowledge, and is traditionally associated with striatal function. While the hippocampus is classically recognized for its role in memory for individual experiences, recent work indicates that it is also involved in probabilistic forms of learning but little is known about the features that support such learning. We hypothesized that adult neurogenesis may be involved, because adult-born neurons contribute to both learning and reward-related behaviors. To test this, we used an appetitive probabilistic reversal learning task where a correct lever is rewarded with 80% probability and an incorrect lever is rewarded with 20% probability. Behavioral flexibility was assessed by switching correct-incorrect lever identities after 8 consecutive correct choices. Transgenic male rats that lacked adult neurogenesis displayed an initial deficit in discriminating the correct and incorrect levers, but they were not impaired at reversing behavior when the reward contingencies switched. When reward was withheld after a correct lever choice, neurogenesis-deficient rats were more likely to choose the incorrect lever on the subsequent trial. Also, rats with intact neurogenesis were more sensitive to reward at the incorrect lever. Differences were not observed in control transgenic rats that had intact neurogenesis. These results identify a novel role for neurogenesis in learning about uncertain, probabilistic rewards. Altered sensitivity to reward and negative feedback furthermore implicates neurogenesis in cognitive phenotypes associated with mood disorders such as depression.

1,Moderate Renal Impairment and Toxic Metabolites Produced by the Intestinal Microbiome: Dietary Implications,"Objective \ Toxic metabolites produced by the intestinal microbiome from animal proteins, carnitine (mainly from red meat), or phosphatidylcholine (mainly from egg yolk), have important adverse effects on cardiovascular disease. These are renally eliminated and may be termed gut-derived uremic toxins (GDUT). We hypothesized that even moderate renal impairment and intake of nutrient precursors would raise plasma levels of GDUT. \ Design \ A cohort study. \ Setting \ Academic medical center. \ Subjects \ Patients attending stroke prevention clinics at a university medical center were recruited. \ Main Outcome Measure \ Nutrient intake was assessed by the 131-item Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was caculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (EPI) equations. Plasma levels of trimethylamine n-oxide, p-cresyl sulfate, hippuric acid, p-cresyl glucuronide, pheny acetyl glutamine, and phenyl sulfate were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. \ Results \ Among 316 patients recruited, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 66.74 (10.42) years; 59.7% were men. Mean eGFR was 76.03 ± 20.01; 57 (18%) had eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Plasma levels of all GDUT were significantly higher even with moderate reduction of eGFR. Nutrient intake affected plasma levels of some GDUT; the effects differed by eGFR above and below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Plasma levels were obtained fasting, so we probably underestimated the effect of nutrient intake. \ Conclusions \ Even moderate impairment of renal function was associated with higher plasma levels of GDUT. This has dietary implications for patients at risk of atherosclerosis, particularly in those with impaired renal function (including the elderly): they should limit intake of animal protein, red meat, and egg yolk. It also points the way to novel approaches to vascular prevention, including more intensive dialysis, renal transplantation, and modification of the intestinal microbiome with probiotics or fecal transplantation."
2,Stress and cognitive functioning during a pandemic: Thoughts from stress researchers.,"In this commentary we discuss a downstream consequence of increases in stress and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress and anxiety can lead to mind wandering, which in turn competes for limited cognitive resources. We encourage researchers to be understanding and patient concerning the inevitable cognitive impact of the pandemic and subsequent reduced productivity levels from our students, colleagues, and ourselves.

3,Well-being after the Virginia Tech mass murder: The relative effectiveness of face-to-face and virtual interactions in providing support to survivors.,"Acts of mass violence such as terrorist attacks or school shootings victimize more than those directly involved. Witness to these acts and members of the attacked community are at risk for increased levels of PTSD, depression, and other forms of mental distress. Research has clearly established that social support is critically important for recovering from such traumatic events (Galea et al. 2002; Johnson, North, & Smith, 2005; Ruzek et al, 2007) as being imbedded in a strong private network of friends and family can provide the emotional support survivors need to effectively cope with the tragedy (Hawdon and Ryan 2011). Given the increased use of e-mail, text messaging, and social networking sites among youth (Hinchcliffe & Gavin, 2009), it is likely that survivors of mass violence use technology to communicate with the members of their private networks (Dutta-Bergman, 2004). However, it is unclear if this 'virtual interaction' can be as effective as face-to-face interaction in providing the needed support. Our research addresses this question using data collected after the 2007 mass murder of 32 people at Virginia Tech. Using data collected from 543 Virginia Tech students, we predict levels of emotional and behavioral well-being five months after the shootings. Our central independent variables include measures of how frequently the students communicated with their friends and families in the week following the tragedy and if these communications were in person or 'virtual.' Results indicate that face-to-face interaction significantly improved well-being; however, interacting with friends and family members through e-mail, text messaging, or some form of online communication was unrelated to well-being. Our findings highlight the importance of face-to-face interactions after acts of mass violence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,A typology of caregiving situations and service use in family carers of older people in six European countries: The EUROFAMCARE study.,"This paper presents the EUROFAMCARE study findings, examining a typology of care situations for family carers of older people, and the interplay of carers with social and health services. Despite the complexity of family caregiving situations across Europe, our analyses determined the existence of seven “caregiving situations,” varying on a range of critical indicators. Our study also describes the availability and use of different support services for carers and care receivers, and carers’ preferences for the characteristics of support services. Our findings have relevance for policy initiatives in Europe, where limited resources need to be more equitably distributed and services should be targeted to caregiving situations reflecting the greatest need, and organized to reflect the preferences of family carers.

3,The impact of LGBT policies on ethnic/racial and gender diversity among business school faculty.,"This study examines how policies targeted to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community impact gender and ethnic/racial diversity within business schools. Specifically, the authors examine domestic-partner benefits, sexual orientation nondiscrimination policies, and gender identity nondiscrimination policies. The cumulative effect of offering multiple policies is also examined. Findings suggest that ethnic/racial diversity of tenure-track business faculty is significantly related to the school offering each of the examined LGBT policies; however, gender diversity was not significantly related. The offering of multiple policies is also a significant predictor of ethnic/racial diversity in business school faculties. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

3,A longitudinal analysis of peer-delivered permanent supportive housing: Impact of housing on mental and overall health in an ethnically diverse population.,"Permanent supportive housing (PSH) is an evidence-based health intervention for persons experiencing homelessness, but the impact of individual mechanisms within this intervention on health requires further research. This study examines the longitudinal impact of the mechanism of supportive housing within a peer-delivered PSH model on overall health and mental health (as measured by psychological distress and self-report of bothersome symptoms) outcomes in an ethnically diverse population. The 237 participants in the study included persons who were homeless or at risk of homelessness and who also had been diagnosed with a serious mental illness. Sixty-one percent of all participants received supportive housing. All 3 outcomes were significantly associated with quality of life indicators, recovery, and social connectedness. In addition, overall health was significantly associated with employment, age, and psychological distress. Psychological distress was associated with gender, type of housing, and history of violence or trauma. Experiencing bothersome symptoms was associated with drug use, history of violence or trauma, and psychological distress. Longitudinal models of these 3 outcomes showed that supportive housing was significantly associated with good to excellent health 6 months after baseline (odds ratio = 3.11, 95% confidence interval [1.12, 8.66]). The models also demonstrated that the supportive housing and comparison groups experienced decreased psychological distress after baseline. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of supportive housing within the context of PSH, particularly for the overall health of participants, and the positive overall impact of PSH on mental health in a diverse population.

2,Preloss grief in family members of COVID-19 patients: Recommendations for clinicians and researchers.,"Researchers have long examined grief-related reactions to the diagnosis of a loved one with a terminal illness, including preloss grief (PLG), which is the experience of grief symptoms prior to the loss of a loved one. Families face novel challenges when loved ones with COVID-19 become critically ill—most notably mandated physical separation—and may experience a wide range of PLG responses. This commentary examines the existing literature related to PLG as a means for understanding the psychological impact of COVID-19 deaths, identifies factors professionals can assess for and address when working with a family member of COVID-19 patients, and identifies areas for future research related to COVID-19 and PLG.

3,Recruiting and hiring women in STEM fields.,"The number of women earning advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has increased, yet women remain underrepresented at all ranks of the academic hierarchy in these fields. To help explain this pattern, we explored mechanisms in the recruitment and hiring process at the level of the department that hinder or promote the hiring of women into tenure-track positions. Using a unique data set of the entire pool of applicants to tenure-track STEM faculty positions over a 6-year period at a large public research university, we identified strategies that universities and academic departments can use to increase women's representation in tenure-track positions, including placing greater emphasis on increasing the number of women applicants and placing advertisements in venues that specifically target women.

1,A unified conceptual framework for prediction and control of microbiomes,"Microbiomes impact nearly all systems on Earth, and despite vast differences among systems, we contend that it is possible and highly beneficial to develop a unified conceptual framework for understanding microbiome dynamics that is applicable across systems. The ability to robustly predict and control environmental and human microbiomes would provide impactful opportunities to sustain and improve the health of ecosystems and humans alike. Doing so requires understanding the processes governing microbiome temporal dynamics, which currently presents an enormous challenge. We contend, however, that new opportunities can emerge by placing studies of both environmental and human microbiome temporal dynamics in the context of a unified conceptual framework. Our conceptual framework poses that factors influencing the temporal dynamics of microbiomes can be grouped into three broad categories: biotic and abiotic history, internal dynamics, and external forcing factors. Both environmental and human microbiome science study these factors, but not in a coordinated or consistent way. Here we discuss opportunities for greater crosstalk across these domains, such as leveraging specific ecological concepts from environmental microbiome science to guide optimization of strategies to manipulate human microbiomes towards improved health. To achieve unified understanding, it is necessary to have a common body of theory developed from explicit iteration between models and molecular-based characterization of microbiome dynamics across systems. Only through such model-experiment iteration will we eventually achieve prediction and control across microbiomes that impact ecosystem sustainability and human health."
2,Rhythm and syntax processing in school-age children.,"Scholars debate whether musical and linguistic abilities are associated or independent. In the present study, we examined whether musical rhythm skills predict receptive grammar proficiency in childhood. In Experiment 1, 7- to 17-year-old children (N = 68) were tested on their grammar and rhythm abilities. In the grammar-comprehension task, children heard short sentences with subject-relative (e.g., “Boys that help girls are nice”) or object-relative (e.g., “Boys that girls help are nice”) clauses, and determined the gender of the individual performing the action. In the rhythm-discrimination test, children heard two short rhythmic sequences on each trial and decided if they were the same or different. Children with better performance on the rhythm task exhibited higher scores on the grammar test, even after holding constant age, gender, music training, and maternal education. In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding with another group of same-age children (N = 96) while further controlling for working memory. Our data reveal, for the first time, an association between receptive grammar and rhythm perception in typically developing children. This finding is consistent with the view that music and language share neural resources for rule-based temporal processing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,Whole grain-rich diet reduces body weight and systemic low-grade inflammation without inducing major changes of the gut microbiome: a randomised cross-over trial,"Objective To investigate whether a whole grain diet alters the gut microbiome and insulin sensitivity, as well as biomarkers of metabolic health and gut functionality. \ Design 60 Danish adults at risk of developing metabolic syndrome were included in a randomised cross-over trial with two 8-week dietary intervention periods comprising whole grain diet and refined grain diet, separated by a washout period of ≥6 weeks. The response to the interventions on the gut microbiome composition and insulin sensitivity as well on measures of glucose and lipid metabolism, gut functionality, inflammatory markers, anthropometry and urine metabolomics were assessed. \ Results 50 participants completed both periods with a whole grain intake of 179±50 g/day and 13±10 g/day in the whole grain and refined grain period, respectively. Compliance was confirmed by a difference in plasma alkylresorcinols (p<0.0001). Compared with refined grain, whole grain did not significantly alter glucose homeostasis and did not induce major changes in the faecal microbiome. Also, breath hydrogen levels, plasma short-chain fatty acids, intestinal integrity and intestinal transit time were not affected. The whole grain diet did, however, compared with the refined grain diet, decrease body weight (p<0.0001), serum inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-6 (p=0.009) and C-reactive protein (p=0.003). The reduction in body weight was consistent with a reduction in energy intake, and IL-6 reduction was associated with the amount of whole grain consumed, in particular with intake of rye. \ Conclusion Compared with refined grain diet, whole grain diet did not alter insulin sensitivity and gut microbiome but reduced body weight and systemic low-grade inflammation. \ Trial registration number NCT01731366; Results."
1,Analysis of the relationship between the gut microbiome and dementia: a cross-sectional study conducted in Japan,"Dysregulation of the gut microbiome is associated with several life-threatening conditions and thus might represent a useful target for the prevention of dementia. However, the relationship between the gut microbial population and dementia has not yet been fully clarified. We recruited outpatients visiting our memory clinic to participate in this study. Information on patient demographics, risk factors, and activities of daily living was collected, and cognitive function was assessed using neuropsychological tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. Fecal samples were obtained, and the gut microbiome was assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, one of the most well-established and reliable 16S ribosomal RNA-based methods for classifying gut microbiota. Patients were divided into two groups, demented and non-demented. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the variables independently associated with dementia. The T-RFLP analysis revealed differences in the composition of the gut microbiome: the number of Bacteroides (enterotype I) was lower and the number of ‘other’ bacteria (enterotype III) was higher in demented than non-demented patients. Multivariable analyses showed that the populations of enterotype I and enterotype III bacteria were strongly associated with dementia, independent of the traditional dementia biomarkers. Further studies of the metabolites of gut microbes are needed to determine the mechanism underlying this association."
2,Lecture capture adds value to attending psychological research methods lectures.,"Lecture capture is increasingly prevalent and provides an effective supplement to attending lectures in psychology. Yet evidence for enhancement of learning is limited to recall of facts in introductory subjects taken within the first year of a psychology degree. The aim of the current study was to explore the generalizabilty of these effects by assessing whether lecture capture adds value to attending lectures in psychological research methods—a subject some students find particularly challenging. During a core second-year undergraduate psychological research methods module, 10 traditional 1-hr lectures were recorded and made available for online viewing using the Panopto lecture capture system. Of 121 students originally registered on the module, 114 took the examination. These students’ grades were cross-referenced with digital records of their attendance and the extent to which they viewed lecture recordings while logged into the virtual learning environment. Students who viewed recorded lectures were found to achieve higher grades in the examination than those who did not, even when attendance at the lectures was included as a covariate. This effect was not an artifact of differences in motivation, engagement, or ability in research methods. These results indicate that lecture capture adds value to attending lectures in psychological research methods. This finding implies that the enhancement of learning from supplemental lecture capture generalizes to novel contexts and is thus not overly constrained by educational level or type of knowledge assessed. Recording lectures may have particular value as a way to support students encountering difficulties studying research methods. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,Harriette Pipes McAdoo (1940–2009).,"The life and genealogy of Harriette Pipes McAdoo reflect the personal and professional struggles of many African American families. A prolific scholar with special expertise on Black families, Harriette was born on the campus of Fort Valley State College, now Fort Valley State University, in Fort Valley, Georgia, on March 15, 1940, to William Harrison Pipes and Anne Howard Russell Pipes. She was the oldest of three siblings. Harriette died unexpectedly on December 21, 2009, in East Lansing, Michigan. Her sister, Willetta Ada Pipes Ewing, survives; a brother, William Howard Pipes, preceded her in death. She is also survived by four children, five grandchildren, and many nieces, nephews, and other relatives. Harriette’s dynamic career in higher education has left a remarkable legacy, touching not only the field of human ecology but also those of sociology and social work. Although Harriette is best known for her research on and scholarly contributions to the understanding of Black families, she also published in a number of related areas, including racial attitudes and self-esteem. Harriette received considerable recognition and countless awards for her professional accomplishments and contributions. Although Harriette has passed on, her contributions will be long remembered. Beyond her commitment to researching Black families, she helped changed the landscape of biases and stereotypes related to African American families and children. She was also an extraordinary mentor, preparing the next generation to carry on her work. She was actively engaged in professional organizations, contributing to policy formation that would have a positive impact on families. Whatever her activity, she was diplomatic and cordial, sustained by her deep faith in God. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,Measuring habit formation through goal-directed response switching.,"Reward-learning theory views habits as stimulus–response links formed through extended reward training. Accordingly, animal research has shown that actions that are initially goal-directed can become habitual after operant overtraining. However, a similar demonstration is absent in human research, which poses a serious problem for translational models of behavior. We propose that response-time (RT) switch cost after operant training can be used as a new, reliable marker for the operation of the habit system in humans. Using a new method, we show that RT switch cost demonstrates the properties that would be expected of a habitual behavior: (a) it increases with overtraining, (b) it increases when rewards are larger, and (c) it increases when time pressure is added to the task, thereby hindering the competing goal-directed system. These results offer a promising new pathway for studying the operation of the habit system in humans. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"

1,SLC39A8 missense variant is associated with Crohn's disease but does not have a major impact on gut microbiome composition in healthy subjects,"Background Gene-microbiome interactions are important in aetiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract consisting of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Scarce studies on gene-microbiome interactions show very little overlap in their results. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that gene-microbiome studies are repeated. We aimed to replicate the association between the SLC39A8 [Thr]391 risk allele and gut microbiome composition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and healthy controls. Methods We collected faecal samples, peripheral blood and extensive phenotype data from 291 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 476 healthy controls. Carrier status information was obtained from whole exome sequencing data, generated using the Illumina HiSeq. The gut microbiome composition was determined by tag-sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Associations between carrier status and disease were tested using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Associations between carriers and gut microbiome composition were determined using principal coordinate analyses, variance explained, alpha diversity and additive general linear models in inflammatory bowel disease, healthy controls and all groups combined. Results Crohn’s disease patients were more often carriers of the missense variant (21/171, 12.3%) than controls (30/476, 6.3%) (OR = 2.1, P = 0.01). We could not identify associations between carrier status and overall gut microbiome composition and microbial richness in all tested groups after correcting for potential confounding factors. We did identify 37 different operational taxonomical units to be associated with carrier status among the tested groups. Two of these 37 were identified before in the discovery study. Conclusions We could confirm the genetic association of the SLC39A8 [Thr]391 risk allele with Crohn’s disease but we could only limited replicate the association in gut microbiome composition. Independent replication of gene-microbiome studies is warranted to identify true biological mechanisms."

3,"Forgotten fantasies? Modernity, reenchantment, and dream consciousness.","Why are dreams easily forgotten or difficult to remember? Dream memory is usually attributed to stored fantasies and imaginations in sleep that have distant or no relevance to waking consciousness. Lack of dream recall suggests the modern emphasis on the significance of waking realities at the expense of oneiric experiences. Yet, in the ancient West and many contemporary non-Western societies, dreaming constitutes an unbroken chain of memory to the organization of everyday life. However, reenchantment in the modern context has given new importance to dream consciousness as vital to the development of the creative self. Emphasis on dream practices or dreamwork as leading to various forms of dream control suggests a quest for mastery of inner space. In this regard, training and motivation in dream recall provide an essential tool for advancing the self's well-being. Dreams are not treated as forgotten fantasies but dynamic pathways to new meanings of the self. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,A prospective study of risk and resilience factors associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms and depression symptoms among Jews and Arabs exposed to repeated acts of terrorism in Israel.,"In the first prospective study, to our knowledge, of the impact of ongoing terrorism and political violence, we analyzed nationally representative data from 560 Jews and 182 Arabs in Israel over a 6-month period. Based on Conservation of Resources (COR) theory (Hobfoll, 1989, 1998), we predicted that exposure to terrorism and political violence would result in psychosocial and economic resource loss and resource lack, which in turn, would be primary predictors of increases in symptoms of posttraumatic stress (PTS) and depression. We also predicted that trauma exposure and PTS symptoms, in particular, would be related to ethnocentrism and support for political violence. Furthermore, based on theory and prior research, we predicted that posttraumatic growth (PTG) would be related to a worsening of symptoms of distress and that distress would be related to increased ethnocentrism and support for extreme political violence for their “cause.” Women, older individuals, and Arabs (compared with Jews) were more likely to have continued psychological distress over time. In addition, using simultaneous equation modeling, we found good fit for a structural model that partially supported our hypotheses. Psychosocial resource loss, PTG, and social support had direct and indirect effects on psychological distress. Political attitudes tended to harden over time but were not prospectively related to PTS or depressive symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"

1,Gut microbiome disruption altered the biotransformation and liver toxicity of arsenic in mice,"The mammalian gut microbiome (GM) plays a critical role in xenobiotic biotransformation and can profoundly affect the toxic effects of xenobiotics. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that gut bacteria have the capability to metabolize arsenic (As); however, the specific roles of the gut microbiota in As metabolism in vivo and the toxic effects of As are largely unknown. Here, we administered sodium arsenite to conventionally raised mice (with normal microbiomes) and GM-disrupted mice with antibiotics to investigate the role of the gut microbiota in As biotransformation and its toxicity. We found that the urinary total As levels of GM-disrupted mice were much higher, but the fecal total As levels were lower, than the levels in the conventionally raised mice. In vitro experiments, in which the GM was incubated with As, also demonstrated that the gut bacteria could adsorb or take up As and thus reduce the free As levels in the culture medium. With the disruption of the gut microbiota, arsenic biotransformation was significantly perturbed. Of note, the urinary monomethylarsonic acid/dimethylarsinic acid ratio, a biomarker of arsenic metabolism and toxicity, was markedly increased. Meanwhile, the expression of genes of one-carbon metabolism, including folr2, bhmt, and mthfr, was downregulated, and the liver S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels were significantly decreased in the As-treated GM-disrupted mice only. Moreover, As exposure altered the expression of genes of the p53 signaling pathway, and the expression of multiple genes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was also changed in the As-treated GM-disrupted mice only. Collectively, disruption of the GM enhances the effect of As on one-carbon metabolism, which could in turn affect As biotransformation. GM disruption also increases the toxic effects of As and may increase the risk of As-induced HCC in mice."
1,A prospective cohort for the investigation of alteration in temporal transcriptional and microbiome trajectories preceding preterm birth: a study protocol,"Introduction Preterm birth (PTB) results from heterogeneous influences and is a major contributor to neonatal mortality and morbidity that continues to have adverse effects on infants beyond the neonatal period. This protocol describes the procedures to determine molecular signatures predictive of PTB through high-frequency sampling during pregnancy, at delivery and the postpartum period. \ Methods and analysis Four hundred first trimester pregnant women from either Myanmar or Thailand of either Karen or Burman ethnicity, with a viable, singleton pregnancy will be enrolled in this non-interventional, prospective pregnancy birth cohort study and will be followed through to the postpartum period. Fortnightly finger prick capillary blood sampling will allow the monitoring of genome-wide transcript abundance in whole blood. Collection of stool samples and vaginal swabs each trimester, at delivery and postpartum will allow monitoring of intestinal and vaginal microbial composition. In a nested case–control analysis, perturbations of transcript abundance in capillary blood as well as longitudinal changes of the gut, vaginal and oral microbiome will be compared between mothers giving birth to preterm and matched cases giving birth to term neonates. Placenta tissue of preterm and term neonates will be used to determine bacterial colonisation as well as for the establishment of coding and non-coding RNA profiles. In addition, RNA profiles of circulating, non-coding RNA in cord blood serum will be compared with those of maternal peripheral blood serum at time of delivery. \ Ethics and dissemination This research protocol that aims to detect perturbations in molecular trajectories preceding adverse pregnancy outcomes was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand (Ethics Reference: TMEC 15–062), the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (Ethics Reference: OxTREC: 33–15) and the local Tak Province Community Ethics Advisory Board.

1,Cross-Domain and Viral Interactions in the Microbiome,"The importance of the microbiome to human health is increasingly recognized and has become a major focus of recent research. However, much of the work has focused on a few aspects, particularly the bacterial component of the microbiome, most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract. Yet humans and other animals can be colonized by a wide array of organisms spanning all domains of life, including bacteria and archaea, unicellular eukaryotes such as fungi, multicellular eukaryotes such as helminths, and viruses. As they share the same host niches, they can compete with, synergize with, and antagonize each other, with potential impacts on their host. Here, we discuss these major groups making up the human microbiome, with a focus on how they interact with each other and their multicellular host."
3,Slice.,"In his attempts to treat the condition vesicovaginal fistula, Dr. J. Marion Sims experimented on black slave women during the 1800s. Within 5 years, a 17 year old slave woman called Anarcha endured 30 operations under the medical supervision of Dr. Sims to repair a vesicovaginal fistula. She suffered these invasive surgeries without the aid of anesthesia. Debates on whether Sims was negligent in failing to administer this form of pain management to disenfranchised women abound. Still, the emotional and physical distress slave women like Anarcha lived through largely remain unexplored in Sims’ biography and medical journal articles. My poem, “Slice,” redresses the disassociated accounts of these women’s lives by placing the emotion and physiological trauma they experienced at the center of a literary piece that seeks to honor their humanity and acknowledge their pain. The feelings embodied in “Slice” convey a poetic interpretation of Anarcha’s experiences because she is the speaker in this poem. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,"Interpretational confounding is due to misspecification, not to type of indicator: Comment on Howell, Breivik, and Wilcox (2007).","R. D. Howell, E. Breivik, and J. B. Wilcox (2007; see record 2007-07830-006) have argued that causal (formative) indicators are inherently subject to interpretational confounding. That is, they have argued that using causal (formative) indicators leads the empirical meaning of a latent variable to be other than that assigned to it by a researcher. Their critique of causal (formative) indicators rests on several claims: (a) A latent variable exists apart from the model when there are effect (reflective) indicators but not when there are causal (formative) indicators, (b) causal (formative) indicators need not have the same consequences, (c) causal (formative) indicators are inherently subject to interpretational confounding, and (d) a researcher cannot detect interpretational confounding when using causal (formative) indicators. This article shows that each claim is false. Rather, interpretational confounding is more a problem of structural misspecification of a model combined with an underidentified model that leaves these misspecifications undetected. Interpretational confounding does not occur if the model is correctly specified whether a researcher has causal (formative) or effect (reflective) indicators. It is the validity of a model not the type of indicator that determines the potential for interpretational confounding. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

3,The relevance of challenge and hindrance appraisals of working conditions for employees’ health.,"Psychosocial risk assessments are frequently applied with an a priori classification of favorable and unfavorable working conditions. However, such classifications contradict transactional stress theory and the results of research that found the effects of work stressors on wellbeing to be dependent on boundary conditions. The challenge/hindrance framework assumes that the effects of stressors on wellbeing depend on their individual appraisal as either challenge (stressors associated with personal gain) or hindrance (stressors associated with constraints). We took a heterogeneous sample of 631 employees and, by taking into account their individual appraisals as challenge or hindrance, studied associations between exposure to working conditions covered by a frequently used psychosocial risk assessment and health outcomes. Our findings confirmed substantial variations of appraisal and confirmed that challenge and hindrance evaluations of exposures to working conditions are not mutually exclusive. Whereas exposure to working conditions was only partly associated with health outcomes, all challenge appraisals were positively related and all hindrance appraisals negatively related with favorable health outcomes. When adjusted for challenge and hindrance appraisal, direct effects on health outcomes were not significant for most of the considered working conditions. Health effects of working conditions were partly mediated by challenge/hindrance appraisals, and appraisal explained more variance in health outcomes than information about exposure to these conditions. Nevertheless, negative health effects were observed for some working conditions (time pressure, qualitative demands, responsibility, and interruptions), even when controlled for employees’ evaluations. We conclude that measures of challenge/hindrance appraisals should be included in occupational risk assessments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,Comparison of the oral microbiome of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis and periodontitis-free subjects,"Objective \ The primary objectives of the study were to assess differences in complex subgingival bacterial composition between periodontitis-free persons and patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gAgP). \ Background \ The composition of the oral microbiota plays an important role for both oral and systemic diseases. However, the complex nature of the oral microbiome and its homeostasis is still poorly understood. \ Material and methods \ We compared the microbiome of 13 periodontitis-free persons to 13 patients with gAgP. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified, targeting the V3/V4 region using the MiSeq platform. \ Results \ In total, 1713 different bacterial species were mapped according to the Greengenes database. Using the Shannon index, no significant differences in alpha diversity were found between the two study groups. In principal component and linear discriminant analyses, disease-specific differences in beta diversity of the microbiome composition were evaluated. Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Synergistetes were more abundant in gAgP whereas Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were associated with a healthy periodontium. At the bacterial species level, we showed that Porphyromonas gingivalis is the strongest indicator of gAgP. Treponema denticola and Tanerella forsythia of the “red complex” as well as Filifactor alocis were among the ten best biomarkers for gAgP. \ Conclusions \ These results broaden our knowledge of disease-specific differences in the microbial community associated with generalized AgP.

These results could help to individually adapt periodontal therapy in these patients."
3,"Managing job burnout: The effects of emotion-regulation ability, emotional labor, and positive and negative affect at work.","The authors examine the relationship between emotion-regulation ability, a key branch of emotional intelligence, and job burnout in 343 Chinese employees from a wide range of occupations and find that emotion-regulation ability is negatively related to job burnout, especially in jobs that require high emotional labor. An objective performance-based test of emotional intelligence shows that positive work affect partially mediates the relationship between emotion-regulation ability and burnout. The study refines understanding of how, to what degree, and under what circumstances emotional intelligence is related to job burnout. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,"An integrated approach to evaluate the impacts of the herbicides glyphosate, 2,4-D and metsulfuron-methyl on soil microbial communities in the Pampas region, Argentina","The intensive use of herbicides in agricultural soils of the Pampas region (Argentina) is a matter of environmental concern. We investigated the impacts of three widely used, post-emergence herbicides, glyphosate, 2,4-dicholorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and metsulfuron-methyl, on soil microbial communities by an integrated approach using short-term soil incubations. The key structural and functional parameters were estimated by culturable aerobic heterotrophic bacterial (AHB) density, substrate-induced respiration (SIR), dehydrogenase activity (DHA), fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis, and functional richness. Functional richness was evaluated as the proportion of carbon sources utilized in microplates containing various carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amino acids and aromatic compounds, and 1,3,5-triphenyiltetrazolium chloride (TTC) as redox dye. Three different soil types (Typic Argiudoll, Typic Haplustoll and Petrocalcic Paleustoll) were collected from agricultural fields with reported history of herbicide application. Soil microcosms were treated with one herbicide at a time at a dose 10 times higher than the recommended field application rates (glyphosate, 150mg a.i. kg−1; 2,4-D, 5mg a.i. kg−1; metsulfuron-methyl, 1mg a.i. kg−1soil) and incubated for up to 3 weeks. Metsulfuron-methyl had the least pronounced effects on soil microbial community. 2,4-D showed transient effects on soils, inhibiting either SIR or FDA and stimulating DHA. Several short-term effects of glyphosate on microbial activities and bacterial density were observed: (1) early stimulation of SIR and AHB; (2) dissimilar response in the soils for FDA and DHA; (3) transient increase in functional richness. To conclude, the addition of these herbicides at a dose 10 times higher than the normal field application rates caused minor changes to soil microbial activity, bacterial density and functional richness. The specific changes varied among herbicides, with the effects of glyphosate most pronounced."
1,The Gut Microbiome as a Target for IBD Treatment: Are We There Yet?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to highlight recent research on the gut microbiome in IBD and the application of microbiome-modulating therapies for the treatment of IBD including the use of the microbiome as an indicator for disease severity and treatment response. \ RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the high number of gut microbiome studies and emerging evidence supporting the gut microbiome's involvement in disease pathogenesis, no single microorganism has been identified as a pathogenic agent in IBD. Retrospective studies and meta-analyses on antibiotic use in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and long-term outcomes are conflicting. Similarly, the use of probiotics for the treatment of IBD remains inconclusive; however, some encouraging results are emerging as microbial concoctions are optimized to include beneficial bacterial strains. Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) is currently emerging as one of the more promising microbiome-modulating IBD therapies. FMT studies in ulcerative colitis have shown improved remission rates compared to placebo; however, relatively small study sample sizes and varied treatment methods, limit definitive conclusions. With clear evidence of an IBD gut dysbiosis, novel therapies to treat and prevent disease relapse will undoubtedly require a microbiome-modulating approach. The complexity and variability of IBD disease pathogenesis (disease phenotype, gut microbiome, host genetic susceptibility, and environmental factors) will likely require a personalized and multidimensional treatment approach where microbiome-modulating therapy is coupled with other therapies to target other IBD disease components."
1,Metabolomics and Microbiomes as Potential Tools to Evaluate the Effects of the Mediterranean Diet,"The approach to studying diet–health relationships has progressively shifted from individual dietary components to overall dietary patterns that affect the interaction and balance of low-molecular-weight metabolites (metabolome) and host-enteric microbial ecology (microbiome). Even though the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been recognized as a powerful strategy to improve health, the accurate assessment of exposure to the MedDiet has been a major challenge in epidemiological and clinical studies. Interestingly, while the effects of individual dietary components on the metabolome have been described, studies investigating metabolomic profiles in response to overall dietary patterns (including the MedDiet), although limited, have been gaining attention. Similarly, the beneficial effects of the MedDiet on cardiometabolic outcomes may be mediated through gut microbial changes. Accumulating evidence linking food ingestion and enteric microbiome alterations merits the evaluation of the microbiome-mediated effects of the MedDiet on metabolic pathways implicated in disease. In this narrative review, we aimed to summarize the current evidence from observational and clinical trials involving the MedDiet by (1) assessing changes in the metabolome and microbiome for the measurement of diet pattern adherence and (2) assessing health outcomes related to the MedDiet through alterations to human metabolomics and/or the microbiome."
2,Making Sense of … the Microbiome in Psychiatry,"Microorganisms can be found almost anywhere, including in and on the human body. The collection of microorganisms associated with a certain location is called a microbiota, with its collective genetic material referred to as the microbiome. The largest population of microorganisms on the human body resides in the gastrointestinal tract; thus, it is not surprising that the most investigated human microbiome is the human gut microbiome. On average, the gut hosts microbes from more than 60 genera and contains more cells than the human body. The human gut microbiome has been shown to influence many aspects of host health, including more recently the brain., Several modes of interaction between the gut and the brain have been discovered, including via the synthesis of metabolites and neurotransmitters, activation of the vagus nerve, and activation of the immune system. A growing body of work is implicating the microbiome in a variety of psychological processes and neuropsychiatric disorders. These include mood and anxiety disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, and even neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Moreover, it is probable that most psychotropic medications have an impact on the microbiome., Here, an overview will be provided for the bidirectional role of the microbiome in brain health, age-associated cognitive decline, and neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, a primer on the common microbiological and bioinformatics techniques used to interrogate the microbiome will be provided. This review is meant to equip the reader with a primer to this exciting research area that is permeating all areas of biological psychiatry research."
1,Talk to your gut: the oral-gut microbiome axis and its immunomodulatory role in the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis,"Microbial communities inhabiting the human body, collectively called the microbiome, are critical modulators of immunity. This notion is underpinned by associations between changes in the microbiome and particular autoimmune disorders. Specifically, in rheumatoid arthritis, one of the most frequently occurring autoimmune disorders worldwide, changes in the oral and gut microbiomes have been implicated in the loss of tolerance against self-antigens and in increased inflammatory events promoting the damage of joints. In the present review, we highlight recently gained insights in the roles of microbes in the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, we address important immunomodulatory processes, including biofilm formation and neutrophil function, which have been implicated in host-microbe interactions relevant for rheumatoid arthritis. Lastly, we present recent advances in the development and evaluation of emerging microbiome-based therapeutic approaches. Altogether, we conclude that the key to uncovering the etiopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis will lie in the immunomodulatory functions of the oral and gut microbiomes.;"
1,Bacterial community structure and effects of picornavirus infection on the anterior nares microbiome in early childhood,"Background: Little is known regarding the nasal microbiome in early childhood and the impact of respiratory infection on the infants' nasal microbial composition. Here we investigated the temporal dynamics and diversity of the bacterial composition in the anterior nares in children attending daycare centers.; Results: For our investigation, we considered 76 parental-taken nasal swabs of 26 children (aged 13 to 36 months) collected over a study period of 3 months. Overall, there was no significant age-specific effect or seasonal shift in the nasal bacterial community structure. In a sub-sample of 14 healthy children the relative abundance of individual taxa as well as the overall diversity did not reveal relevant changes, indicating a stable community structure over the entire study period. Moreover, the nasal bacterial profiles clustered subject-specific with Bray-Curtis similarities being elevated in intra-subject calculations compared to between-subject calculations. The remaining subset of 12 children provided samples taken during picornavirus infection (PVI) and either before or after a PVI. We detected an association between the relative abundance of members of the genus Streptococcus and PV when comparing both (i) samples taken during PVI with samples out of 14 healthy children and (ii) samples taken during PVI with samples taken after PVI within the same individual. In addition, the diversity was higher during PVI than after infection.; Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a personalized structure of the nasal bacterial community is established already in early childhood and could be detected over a timeframe of 3 months. Studies following infants over a longer time with frequent swab sampling would allow investigating whether certain parameter of the bacterial community, such as the temporal variability, could be related to viral infection.;"
3,Ethnic and age differences in eating disorder symptomatology among Albertan women.,"Ethnic and age differences in body mass index (BMI), body shame, and eating disorder symptomatology were investigated in a representative, nonclinical sample (N = 601) of women from the Province of Alberta. Women reported ethnicity (White, Hispanic, Aboriginal, Asian), age, height, and weight (used to calculate BMI), and items measuring body shame and eating disorder symptomatology. Strong ethnic differences were observed. Aboriginal women reported significantly higher BMI than Hispanic and Asian women. Hispanic women reported higher body shame than White women. Hispanic women also reported more bulimic behaviour than White, Aboriginal, and Asian women. White women reported lower body satisfaction than Asian and Aboriginal women. Aboriginal women reported the highest body satisfaction. Bulimic behaviour was lowest in older women (65+ years) compared with other age groups. Body satisfaction was greatest in older women (65+ years). These study findings have important implications for theory, research, and practise, as our society continues to place an inordinate value on thinness and beauty as ideals for women and girls.

3,An Embodied Neurocomputational Framework for Organically Integrating Biopsychosocial Processes: An Application to the Role of Social Support in Health and Disease,"Objective Two distinct perspectives—typically referred to as the biopsychosocial and biomedical models—currently guide clinical practice. Although the role of psychosocial factors in contributing to physical and mental health outcomes is widely recognized, the biomedical model remains dominant. This is due in part to (a) the largely nonmechanistic focus of biopsychosocial research and (b) the lack of specificity it currently offers in guiding clinicians to focus on social, psychological, and/or biological factors in individual cases. In this article, our objective is to provide an evidence-based and theoretically sophisticated mechanistic model capable of organically integrating biopsychosocial processes. \         Methods To construct this model, we provide a narrative review of recent advances in embodied cognition and predictive processing within computational neuroscience, which offer mechanisms for understanding individual differences in social perceptions, visceral responses, health-related behaviors, and their interactions. We also review current evidence for bidirectional influences between social support and health as a detailed illustration of the novel conceptual resources offered by our model. \         Results When integrated, these advances highlight multiple mechanistic causal pathways between psychosocial and biological variables. \         Conclusions By highlighting these pathways, the resulting model has important implications motivating a more psychologically sophisticated, person-specific approach to future research and clinical application in the biopsychosocial domain. It also highlights the potential for quantitative computational modeling and the design of novel interventions. Finally, it should aid in guiding future research in a manner capable of addressing the current criticisms/limitations of the biopsychosocial model and may therefore represent an important step in bridging the gap between it and the biomedical perspective."
2,The Gut–Brain Axis and the Microbiome: Mechanisms and Clinical Implications,"Background & Aims \ Based largely on results from preclinical studies, the concept of a brain gut microbiome axis has been established, mediating bidirectional communication between the gut, its microbiome, and the nervous system. Limited data obtained in human beings suggest that alterations in these interactions may play a role in several brain gut disorders. \ Methods \ We reviewed the preclinical and clinical literature related to the topic of brain gut microbiome interactions. \ Results \ Well-characterized bidirectional communication channels, involving neural, endocrine, and inflammatory mechanisms, exist between the gut and the brain. Communication through these channels may be modulated by variations in the permeability of the intestinal wall and the blood-brain barrier. Brain gut microbiome interactions are programmed during the first 3 years of life, including the prenatal period, but can be modulated by diet, medications, and stress throughout life. Based on correlational studies, alterations in these interactions have been implicated in the regulation of food intake, obesity, and in irritable bowel syndrome, even though causality remains to be established. \ Conclusions \ Targets within the brain gut microbiome axis have the potential to become targets for novel drug development for brain gut disorders."
1,Bi-directional drug-microbiome interactions of anti-diabetics,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become a global epidemic. Although several drugs are available to manage T2D, problems associated with person-to-person variability in drug efficacy and potential side-effects remain unresolved. Owing to the emerging role of the gut microbiome in obesity and T2D, the interaction between gut microbes and anti-diabetic drugs and its influence on drugs' functions remains of immediate research interest. On one hand, drugs can manipulate gut microbiome composition and metabolic capacity. Conversely, the metabolic activities of the microbiome and its metabolites can also influence drug metabolism and effects. Hence, understanding this bi-directional drug-microbiome interaction and how it influences the clinical outcomes of antidiabetic drugs can pave the way to develop next-generation strategies to ameliorate diabetes. This review presents evidences demonstrating the putative interactions between anti-diabetic drugs and the gut microbiome, and discusses the potential of microbiome modulators to manipulate drug-microbiome interactions and the drug metabolism."
2,Words or numbers? Communicating probability in intelligence analysis.,"Intelligence analysis is fundamentally an exercise in expert judgment made under conditions of uncertainty. These judgments are used to inform consequential decisions. Following the major intelligence failure that led to the 2003 war in Iraq, intelligence organizations implemented policies for communicating probability in their assessments. Virtually all chose to convey probability using standardized linguistic lexicons in which an ordered set of select probability terms (e.g., highly likely) is associated with numeric ranges (e.g., 80–90%). We review the benefits and drawbacks of this approach, drawing on psychological research on probability communication and studies that have examined the effectiveness of standardized lexicons. We further discuss how numeric probabilities can overcome many of the shortcomings of linguistic probabilities. Numeric probabilities are not without drawbacks (e.g., they are more difficult to elicit and may be misunderstood by receivers with poor numeracy). However, these drawbacks can be ameliorated with training and practice, whereas the pitfalls of linguistic probabilities are endemic to the approach. We propose that, on balance, the benefits of using numeric probabilities outweigh their drawbacks. Given the enormous costs associated with intelligence failure, the intelligence community should reconsider its reliance on using linguistic probabilities to convey probability in intelligence assessments. Our discussion also has implications for probability communication in other domains such as climate science. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,Emotion regulation self-efficacy mediates the relation between happiness emotion goals and depressive symptoms: A cross-lagged panel design.,"The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that unrealistically high happiness emotion goals lead to decreased emotion regulation self-efficacy, which in turn, leads to depressive symptoms. A cross-lagged panel design with data collection at three time points was used to allow for causal inferences of directionality among study variables. Participants (N = 181) completed a battery of self-report questionnaires at a baseline assessment session (T1). The same measures were completed again at 6- (T2) and 12-month (T3) follow-up sessions. Results of a cross-lagged path analysis indicated that emotion regulation self-efficacy at T2 mediated the relation between happiness emotion goals at T1 and depressive symptoms at T3, thus confirming the primary study hypothesis. To decrease the likelihood that one will experience depressive symptoms, vulnerable individuals may benefit from preemptive efforts that help recalibrate emotion goals in a realistic manner or shift attention toward end-state goals that are not emotion related.

2,Psychological adjustment during the global outbreak of COVID-19: A resilience perspective.,"Amid the global outbreak of COVID-19, resilience is likely to be one of the many possible outcomes. Studies pertaining to resilience following potentially traumatic events including disease outbreak have shown that the vast majority of individuals are resilient, and that outcomes depend on a combination of resilience factors including exposure severity, individual differences, family context, and community characteristics. To better understand psychological dysfunction and resilience during the global outbreak of COVID-19, researchers are encouraged to investigate long-term patterns of mental health rather than cross-sectional prevalence rates, adopt prospective designs and analyses, integrate multiple risk and resilience factors to enhance outcome prediction, and consider the importance of flexibility as the situation unfolds.

1,Cultivated Human Vaginal Microbiome Communities Impact Zika and Herpes Simplex Virus Replication in ex vivo Vaginal Mucosal Cultures,"The human vaginal microbiome (VMB) is a complex bacterial community that interacts closely with vaginal epithelial cells (VEC) impacting the mucosal phenotype and its responses to pathogenic insults. The VMB and VEC relationship includes nutrient exchange and regulation of signaling molecules that controls numerous host functions and defends against invading pathogens. To better understand infection and replication of sexually transmitted viral pathogens in the human vaginal mucosa we used our ex vivo VEC multilayer culture system. We tested the hypothesis that selected VMB communities could be identified that alter the replication of sexually transmitted viruses consistent with reported clinical associations. Sterile VEC multilayer cultures or those colonized with VMB dominated by specific Lactobacillus spp, or VMB lacking lactobacilli, were infected with Zika virus, (ZIKV) a single stranded RNA virus, or Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2), a double stranded DNA virus. The virus was added to the apical surface of the cultured VEC multilayer to model transmission during vaginal intercourse. Viral replication was measured 48h later by qPCR. The results indicated that VEC cultures colonized by VMB containing Staphylococcus spp, previously reported as inflammatory, significantly reduced the quantity of viral genomes produced by ZIKV. HSV-2 titers were decreased by nearly every VMB tested relative to the sterile control, although Lactobacillus spp-dominated VMBs caused the greatest reduction in HSV-2 titer consistent with clinical observations. To explore the mechanism for reduced ZIKV titers, we investigated inflammation created by ZIKV infection, VMB colonization or pre-exposure to selected TLR agonists. Finally, expression levels of human beta defensins 1-3 were quantified in cultures infected by ZIKV and those colonized by VMBs that impacted ZIKV titers. The data presented expands the utility of this ex vivo model system providing controlled and reproducible methods to study the VMB impact on STIs and indicated a correlation between viral replication and specific bacterial species within the VMB."
2,Age and job fit: The relationship between demands–ability fit and retirement and health.,"Understanding the antecedents of retirement and health is increasingly important given the proportion of older adults in the global workforce. The current study examines the relationship between the demands–ability facet of person–job fit and retirement status and health. The sample consists of older workers and retired adults (N = 383) from the Study of Cognition and Aging in the U.S.A. (a national study of age and cognitive abilities). Objective demands–ability fit was operationalized as the fit between a person’s cognitive abilities assessed with an extensive battery of reasoning (fluid abilities) and knowledge (crystallized abilities) and relevant job demands taken from the Occupational Information Network. Results indicated that as the congruence between workers’ reasoning abilities and job demands increased, workers reported fewer chronic health conditions. When reasoning abilities required by a job exceeded worker abilities, workers reported more health conditions and were more likely to be retired versus working. Fewer health conditions were reported when reasoning abilities exceeded reasoning job demands. Congruence for knowledge abilities and demands fit was significant only at medium levels of knowledge abilities and demands. Overall, these results suggest that demands–ability fit is relevant to the experience of work in older age. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,Gut microbiome and brain functional connectivity in infants-a preliminary study focusing on the amygdala,"Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the possibility that microbial communities inhabiting the human gut could affect cognitive development and increase risk for mental illness via the 'microbiome-gut-brain axis.' Infancy likely represents a critical period for the establishment of these relationships, as it is the most dynamic stage of postnatal brain development and a key period in the maturation of the microbiome. Indeed, recent reports indicate that characteristics of the infant gut microbiome are associated with both temperament and cognitive performance. The neural circuits underlying these relationships have not yet been delineated. To address this gap, resting-state fMRI scans were acquired from 39 1-year-old human infants who had provided fecal samples for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa. Measures of alpha diversity were generated and tested for associations with measures of functional connectivity. Primary analyses focused on the amygdala as manipulation of the gut microbiota in animal models alters the structure and neurochemistry of this brain region. Secondary analyses explored functional connectivity of nine canonical resting-state functional networks. Alpha diversity was significantly associated with functional connectivity between the amygdala and thalamus and between the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula. These regions play an important role in processing/responding to threat. Alpha diversity was also associated with functional connectivity between the supplementary motor area (SMA, representing the sensorimotor network) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Importantly, SMA-IPL connectivity also related to cognitive outcomes at 2 years of age, suggesting a potential pathway linking gut microbiome diversity and cognitive outcomes during infancy. These results provide exciting new insights into the gut-brain axis during early human development and should stimulate further studies into whether microbiome-associated changes in brain circuitry influence later risk for psychopathology."
1,Grape berry surface bacterial microbiome: impact from the varieties and clones in the same vineyard from central China,"Aims Bacterial microbiome on grape berry surface may play an important role in grape quality and health. This study aims to investigate the impact of grape varieties and clones on grape berry surface bacterial microbiome from the same vineyard. Methods and Results High-throughput sequencing strategy was used to investigate the bacterial diversity and abundance on the grape surfaces of 12 clones belonging to six varieties grown in the same vineyard of Zhengzhou Fruit Research Institute in Henan Province. In total, 45 bacterial phyla and 933 genera were detected from all samples. Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the most abundant and prevalent phyla, while Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes were grape clone specific phyla. The nonrank genus from phylum Cyanobacteria occupied 30–81% of grape clones from Italian Riesling (GRX), Cabernet Franc (PLZ), Pinot Blanc (BBN) and Riesling (LSL). Interestingly, Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Lactococcus were the only three prevalent genera found on all the clones. Furthermore, the predicted functional activities of grape surface bacterial communities varied according to the clones. Conclusions The present study revealed that in addition to the grape varieties, the variations in grape clone background may also affect the bacterial microbiome on grape surfaces which may ultimately determine their functional activities. Significance and Impact of the Study This research provides an important information for grape planting and wine fermentation that not only the grape varieties need to be paid attention but also grape clones from the specific variety need to be concerned."
2,Noncoercive human intelligence gathering.,"Despite widespread recognition that coercive methods for intelligence gathering are unethical and counterproductive, there is an absence of empirical evidence for effective alternatives. We compared 2 noncoercive methods—the Modified Cognitive Interview (MCI) and Controlled Cognitive Engagement (CCE)—adapted for intelligence gathering by adding a moral frame to encourage interviewees to consciously consider sharing intelligence. Participants from the general population experienced an unexpected live event where equipment was damaged, and an argument ensued. Prior to interview, participants were incentivized to withhold information about a target individual implicated in the event. CCE yielded more target information more frequently than MCI (67% vs. 36%). Similarly, framing yielded target information more often (65% vs. 39%). The effects of interview and framing appear to be additive rather than interactive. Our results indicate combining noncoercive interview methods with moral framing can enhance intelligence gain.

1,The Human Mesenteric Lymph Node Microbiome Differentiates Between Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis,"Background and Aims \ Mesenteric lymph nodes are sites in which translocated bacteria incite and progress immunological responses. For this reason, understanding the microbiome of mesenteric lymph nodes in inflammatory bowel disease is important. The bacterial profile of Crohn’s disease mesenteric lymph nodes has been analysed using culture-independent methods in only one previous study. This study aimed to investigate the mesenteric lymph node microbiota from both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis patients. \  \ Methods \ Mesenteric lymph nodes were collected from Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis patients undergoing resection. Total DNA was extracted from mesenteric lymph nodes and assessed for the presence of bacterial DNA [16S]. All work was completed in a sterile environment using aseptic techniques. Samples positive for 16S DNA underwent next-generation sequencing, and the identity of bacterial phyla and species were determined. \  \ Results \ Crohn’s disease mesenteric lymph nodes had a distinctly different microbial profile to that observed in ulcerative colitis. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was greater in nodes from ulcerative colitis patients, whereas Proteobacteria were more abundant in Crohn’s disease. Although species diversity was reduced in the mesenteric lymph nodes of patients with Crohn’s disease, these lymph nodes contained greater numbers of less dominant phyla, mainly Fusobacteria. \  \ Conclusion \ This study confirms that there are distinct differences between the Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis mesenteric lymph node microbiomes. Such microbial differences could aid in the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, particularly in cases of indeterminate colitis at time of resection, or help explain their mechanisms of development and progression."
1,A finite mixture model for X-chromosome association with an emphasis on microbiome data analysis,"Analysis of the X chromosome has been largely neglected in genetic studies mainly because of complex underlying biological mechanisms. On the other hand, the study of human microbiome data (typically over-dispersed counts with an excess of zeros) has generated great interest recently because of advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies. We propose a novel approach to infer the association between host genetic variants in the X-chromosome and microbiome data. The method accounts for random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), skewed (or nonrandom) XCI (XCI-S), and escape of XCI (XCI-E). The inference is performed through a finite mixture model (FMM), in which an indicator variable denoting the “true” biological mechanism is treated as missing data. An expectation-maximization algorithm on zero-inflated and two-part models is implemented to estimate genetic effects. We investigate the performance of the FMM along with strategies that assume XCI and XCI-E mechanisms for all subjects compared with alternative approaches. Briefly, an XCI mechanism codes males’ genotypes as homozygous females, whereas under XCI-E, males are treated as heterozygous females. By comprehensive simulations, we evaluate tests of the hypothesis under a computationally efficient score statistic. In summary, the FMM renders reduced bias and commensurate power compared to XCI, XCI-E, and alternative strategies while maintaining adequate Type 1 error control. The proposed method has far-reaching applications. In particular, we illustrate its usage on a large-scale human microbiome study, the Genetic, Environmental and Microbial (GEM) project, to test for the genetic association on the X chromosome."
2,A multiple baseline study of a brief alcohol reduction and family engagement intervention for fathers in Kenya.,"Objective: To evaluate a lay provider-delivered, brief intervention to reduce problem drinking and related family consequences among men in Kenya. The 5-session intervention combines behavioral activation (BA) and motivational interviewing (MI). It integrates family-related material explicitly and addresses central cultural factors through gender transformative strategies. Method: A nonconcurrent multiple-baseline design was used. We initiated treatment with 9 men ages 30 to 48 who were fathers and screened positive for problem drinking; the median Alcohol Use Identification Test score was 17 (harmful range). Participants were randomized to staggered start dates. We measured the primary outcome of weekly alcohol consumption 4 weeks before treatment, during treatment, and 4 weeks posttreatment using the Timeline Followback measure. Secondary outcomes were assessed using a pre–post assessment (1-month) of men’s depression symptoms, drinking- and family-related problem behavior, involvement with child, time with family, family functioning, relationship quality (child and partner), and harsh treatment of child and partner. Men, partners, and children (ages 8–17) reported on family outcomes. Results: Eight men completed treatment. Mixed-effects hurdle model analysis showed that alcohol use, both number of days drinking and amount consumed, significantly decreased during and after treatment. Odds of not drinking were 5.1 times higher posttreatment (95% CI [3.3, 7.9]). When men did drink posttreatment, they drank 50% less (95% CI [0.39, 0.65]). Wilcoxon signed-ranks test demonstrated pre–post improvements in depression symptoms and family related outcomes. Conclusion: Results provide preliminary evidence that a BA-MI intervention developed for lay providers may reduce alcohol use and improve family outcomes among men in Kenya.

3,The need for a new medical model: A challenge for biomedicine,"Although it seems that acceptance of the medical model by psychiatry would finally end confusion about its goals, methods, and outcomes, the present article argues that current crises in both psychiatry and medicine as a whole stem from their adherence to a model of disease that is no longer adequate for the work and responsibilities of either field. It is noted that psychiatrists have responded to their crisis by endorsing 2 apparently contradictory positions, one that would exclude psychiatry from the field of medicine and one that would strictly adhere to the medical model and limit the work of psychiatry to behavioral disorders of an organic nature. Characteristics of the dominant biomedical model of disease are identified, and historical origins and limitations of this reductionistic view are examined. A biopsychosocial model is proposed that would encompass all factors related to both illness and patienthood. Implications for teaching and health care delivery are considered.

1,Exploiting the Oral Microbiome to Prevent Tooth Decay: Has Evolution Already Provided the Best Tools?,"To compete in the relatively exposed oral cavity, resident microbes must avoid being replaced by newcomers. This selective constraint, coupled with pressure on the host to cultivate a beneficial microbiome, has rendered a commensal oral microbiota that displays colonization resistance, protecting the human host from invasive species, including pathogens. Rapid increases in carbohydrate consumption have disrupted the evolved homeostasis between the oral microbiota and dental health, reflected by the high prevalence of dental caries. Development of novel modalities to prevent caries has been the subject of a breadth of research. This mini review provides highlights of these endeavors and discusses the rationale and pitfalls behind the major avenues of approach. Despite efficacy, fluoride and other broad-spectrum interventions are unlikely to further reduce the incidence of dental caries. The most promising methodologies in development are those that exploit the exclusive nature of the healthy oral microbiome. Probiotics derived from the dental plaque of healthy individuals sharply antagonize cariogenic species, such as Streptococcus mutans. Meanwhile, targeted antimicrobials allow for the killing of specific pathogens, allowing reestablishment of a healthy microbiome, presumably with its protective effects. The oral microbiota manufactures a massive array of small molecules, some of which are correlated with health and are likely to antagonize pathogens. The prohibitive cost associated with sufficiently rigorous clinical trials, and the status of dental caries as a non-life-threatening condition will likely continue to impede the advancement of new therapeutics to market. Nevertheless, there is room for optimism, as it appears evolution may have already provided the best tools."
3,A modified framework for identifying stigma: News coverage of persons with mental illness killed by police.,"This article examines the types of stigmatizing language and frames present in news reports about persons with mental illness killed by police. A sample of 301 online news reports was content analyzed, of which 132 reports contributed to 231 examples of stigmatizing language or frames. Analysis indicates that the construction of stigma in these news reports does not fully adhere to existing frameworks for identifying stigmatization. Stigmatization that is implicit, and often seemingly innocuous, is almost three times as common in the analyzed news reports than overt and explicit forms of stigmatization. A modified framework for identifying stigmatization is proposed that includes the presence of stigmatizing syntax, implicit stereotypes, stigmatizing myths, and behavior labeling. To the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to examine media stigmatization of persons with mental illness killed by police as well as explore stigmatization regarding suicide by cop. Implications of the findings for efforts to destigmatize mental illness are explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,Soil biodiversity and human health,"Soil biodiversity is increasingly recognized as providing benefits to human health because it can suppress disease-causing soil organisms and provide clean air, water and food. Poor land-management practices and environmental change are, however, affecting belowground communities globally, and the resulting declines in soil biodiversity reduce and impair these benefits. Importantly, current research indicates that soil biodiversity can be maintained and partially restored if managed sustainably. Promoting the ecological complexity and robustness of soil biodiversity through improved management practices represents an underutilized resource with the ability to improve human health."
2,A randomized controlled trial of central executive training (CET) versus inhibitory control training (ICT) for ADHD.,"Objective: Executive function deficits are well-established in ADHD. Unfortunately, replicated evidence indicates that executive function training for ADHD has been largely unsuccessful. We hypothesized that this may reflect insufficient targeting, such that extant protocols do not sufficiently and specifically target the neurocognitive systems associated with phenotypic ADHD behaviors/impairments. Method: Children with ADHD ages 8–12 (M = 10.41, SD = 1.46; 12 girls; 74% Caucasian/Non-Hispanic) were randomized with allocation concealment to either central executive training (CET; n = 25) or newly developed inhibitory control training (ICT; n = 29). Detailed data analytic plans were preregistered. Results: Both treatments were feasible/acceptable based on training duration, child-reported ease of use, and parent-reported high satisfaction. CET was superior to ICT for improving its primary intervention targets: phonological and visuospatial working memory (d = 0.70–0.84). CET was also superior to ICT for improving go/no-go (d = 0.84) but not stop-signal inhibition. Mechanisms of change analyses indicated that CET-related working memory improvements produced significant reductions in the primary clinical endpoints (objectively assessed hyperactivity) during working memory and inhibition testing (indirect effects: β ≥ −.11; 95% CIs exclude 0.0). CET was also superior to ICT on 3 of 4 secondary clinical endpoints (blinded teacher-rated ADHD symptoms; d = 0.46–0.70 vs. 0.16–0.42) and 2 of 4 feasibility/acceptability clinical endpoints (parent-reported ADHD symptoms; d = 0.96–1.42 vs. 0.45–0.65). CET-related gains were maintained at 2–4 month follow-up; ICT-related gains were maintained for attention problems but not hyperactivity/impulsivity per parent report. Conclusions: Results support the use of CET for treating executive function deficits and targeting ADHD behavioral symptoms in children with ADHD. Findings for ICT were mixed at best and indicate the need for continued development/study. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,A comparison of imitation training using concurrent versus delayed prompting.,"The ability to imitate can facilitate the learning of a variety of skills. However, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often lack this ability. Valentino, LeBlanc, and Conde (2018) demonstrated that the use of a second therapist to eliminate the delay between the imitative model and the response opportunity effectively established imitative responding exhibited by 1 subject. The present study replicated and extended this finding by separately examining the effects of the second therapist and the delay. Three participants with ASD were exposed to 3 conditions: a 1-therapist, delayed-prompt condition; a 2-therapist, delayed-prompt condition; and a 2-therapist, concurrent-prompt condition. Differentiated responding across conditions occurred in 3 of 6 sets. With respect to determining the most efficient prompting condition, this study yielded mixed results across participants and sets. The condition that most closely resembled the standard instructional arrangement (1-therapist, delayed-prompt condition) was found to be most efficient only 17% of the time. Directions for future research on concurrent prompting during imitation training and the clinical implications of our findings, taken together with those of Valentino et al., are discussed.

1,Maternal microbiome and pregnancy outcomes,"Alterations of the human microbiome are a known characteristic of various inflammatory disease states and have been linked to spontaneous preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recent advances in metagenomic research have proven that the placenta harbors its own rich diverse microbiome, even in clinically healthy pregnancies, and preterm birth may be a result of hematogenous infection rather than exclusively ascending infection as previously hypothesized. In this review, we describe the microbiome in healthy nongravid and gravid women to contrast it with the alterations of the microbiome associated with spontaneous preterm birth. We also discuss the importance of host gene-environment interactions and the potential for microbiota-specific targeted therapies to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes."
2,How individuals perceive time in an anxious state: The mediating effect of attentional bias.,"Three experiments were conducted to investigate the mediating effect of attentional bias on the relationship between state anxiety and time perception. In Experiment 1, state anxiety (high and low) was manipulated by a standardized induction procedure, attentional bias was tested by a dot-probe task, and time perception of words (negative and neutral) was tested by a time reproduction task in which a standard duration of 2 s was used. In Experiment 2, multiple durations (2, 4, and 8 s) were tested within subjects, and negative and neutral low-arousal pictures were selected for the dot-probe task and the time reproduction task. In Experiment 3, attentional bias was manipulated by an attentional bias modification training to test the causal relationship between attentional bias and time perception. The results suggested that (a) participants in an anxious state showed an attentional bias toward negative stimuli and perceived a 2-s duration as longer when stimuli were negative as opposed to when they were neutral, (b) attentional bias toward negative stimuli mediated the influence of state anxiety on time perception, and (c) attentional bias had a direct impact on time perception. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the role that attention plays in how individuals perceive time in an anxious state and provide novel evidence supporting the attentional gate model.

3,Microbiomes as Metacommunities: Understanding Host-Associated Microbes through Metacommunity Ecology,"Interest in host-associated microbiomes has skyrocketed recently, yet our ability to explain microbiome variation has remained stubbornly low. Considering scales of interaction beyond the level of the individual host could lead to new insights. Metacommunity theory has many of the tools necessary for modeling multiscale processes and has been successfully applied to host microbiomes. However, the biotic nature of the host requires an expansion of theory to incorporate feedback between the habitat patch (host) and their local (microbial) community. This feedback can have unexpected effects, is predicted to be common, and can arise through a variety of mechanisms, including developmental, ecological, and evolutionary processes. We propose a new way forward for both metacommunity theory and host microbiome research that incorporates this feedback."
2,Daily illness appraisal and collaboration in couples with type 1 diabetes.,"Objective: Dyadic coping theories posit that spousal involvement may benefit illness management through collaborative and supportive (C&S) strategies and shared illness appraisals. Illness appraisals have only been examined as individual differences rather than fluctuating daily as individuals manage the difficult Type 1 diabetes regimen. The study examined how daily illness appraisals of individuals with Type 1 diabetes and their spouses were linked to spouses’ daily C&S strategies and whether C&S strategies were most beneficial for daily diabetes outcomes when they occurred in the context of shared illness appraisals. Method: Couples (N = 199) in which one person had Type 1 diabetes (M age patients = 46.81; 52.3% female; spouses = 46.40, 47.5% female) completed a 14-day diary assessing illness appraisals (ranging from nonshared through shared) and spouses’ C&S strategies. Patients reported daily self-regulation failures, self-care behaviors, and perceived coping effectiveness. Daily blood glucose was gathered from glucometers. Results: Multilevel models indicated both within-person and between-person effects of patients’ and spouses’ illness appraisals on C&S strategies with higher shared illness appraisals associated with greater C&S strategies. Greater shared illness appraisals were associated with fewer self-regulation failures and better self-care. C&S strategies were associated with lower self-care and higher blood glucose levels. Appraisal interacted with C&S strategies such that C&S strategies were associated with more self-regulation failures, lower self-care, and lower perceived coping effectiveness when patients reported lower shared appraisals. Conclusions: Results suggest that C&S strategies may be more detrimental for diabetes management when individuals view diabetes as less shared.

1,High-Throughput Sequencing of the 16S rRNA Gene as a Survey to Analyze the Microbiomes of Free-Living Ciliates Paramecium,"Ciliates are the largest group of ubiquitous aquatic bacterivorous protists, and many species are easily cultivated. However, only few studies reported prokaryotic communities naturally associated with ciliate cells. Herein, we analyzed the microbiome composition of several strains of Paramecium (Ciliophora) originating from different locations and belonging to two morpho-species by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the 16S rRNA gene. Possible reasons of HTS results bias were addressed comparing DNA libraries obtained using different primers and different number of ciliate cells. Microbiomes associated with ciliates and their environments were always significantly different by prokaryotic taxonomic composition and bacterial richness. There were also pronounced differences between Paramecium strains. Interestingly, potentially pathogenic bacteria were revealed in Paramecium microbiomes."
3,Being drunk to have fun or to forget problems? Identifying enhancement and coping drinkers among risky drinking adolescents.,"Prevention programs in adolescence are particularly effective if they target homogeneous risk groups of adolescents who share a combination of particular needs and problems. The present work aims to identify and classify risky single-occasion drinking (RSOD) adolescents according to their motivation to engage in drinking. An easy-to-use coding procedure was developed. It was validated by means of cluster analyses and structural equation modeling based on two randomly selected subsamples of a nationally representative sample of 2,449 12- to 18-year-old RSOD students in Switzerland. Results revealed that the coding procedure classified RSOD adolescents as either enhancement drinkers or coping drinkers. The high concordance (Sample A: κ = .88, Sample B: κ = .90) with the results of the cluster analyses demonstrated the convergent validity of the coding classification. The fact that enhancement drinkers in both subsamples were found to go out more frequently in the evenings and to have more satisfactory social relationships, as well as a higher proportion of drinking peers and a lower likelihood to drink at home than coping drinkers demonstrates the concurrent validity of the classification. To conclude, the coding procedure appears to be a valid, reliable, and easy-to-use tool that can help better adapt prevention activities to adolescent risky drinking motives.

2,Affect variability and inflammatory markers in midlife adults.,"Objective: Higher affect variability (the extent to which individuals vary in their affect over time) has been associated with poorer health indicators, but associations with inflammation are less well understood. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether affect variability was associated with inflammation in ways consistent with the stability theory or the fragile positive affect theory, and whether associations were linear or nonlinear. Method: In a racially diverse sample (N = 231; Aged 25–65; 65% female; 62% Black; 25% Hispanic), we examined whether positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) variability exhibited linear or quadratic associations with circulating inflammatory cytokines (a composite measure comprised of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ), and C-reactive protein (CRP) and whether person-mean affect moderated these associations. Affective states were assessed using ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) 5 times per day for 2 weeks, with a blood draw at the end of the EMA period. Individual standard deviations of affective states indexed affect variability. Results: A quadratic association indicated that moderate NA variability was associated with lower CRP. There was evidence of significant moderation by linear associations with PA only: For those with higher person-mean PA, PA variability was positively associated with the cytokine composite. Both person-mean PA and person-mean NA moderated quadratic associations, such that for those with high person-mean affect, both high and low affect variability was associated with systemic inflammation. Conclusion: Results are in line with fragile affect theory suggesting that associations between affect variability and health indicators may vary by person-mean affect.

1,"Extensive Unexplored Human Microbiome Diversity Revealed by Over 150,000 Genomes from Metagenomes Spanning Age, Geography, and Lifestyle","The body-wide human microbiome plays a role in health, but its full diversity remains uncharacterized, particularly outside of the gut and in international populations. We leveraged 9,428 metagenomes to reconstruct 154,723 microbial genomes (45% of high quality) spanning body sites, ages, countries, and lifestyles. We recapitulated 4,930 species-level genome bins (SGBs), 77% without genomes in public repositories (unknown SGBs [uSGBs]). uSGBs are prevalent (in 93% of well-assembled samples), expand underrepresented phyla, and are enriched in non-Westernized populations (40% of the total SGBs). We annotated 2.85 M genes in SGBs, many associated with conditions including infant development (94,000) or Westernization (106,000). SGBs and uSGBs permit deeper microbiome analyses and increase the average mappability of metagenomic reads from 67.76% to 87.51% in the gut (median 94.26%) and 65.14% to 82.34% in the mouth. We thus identify thousands of microbial genomes from yet-to-be-named species, expand the pangenomes of human-associated microbes, and allow better exploitation of metagenomic technologies.; Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

1,Association of prevalent vaginal microbiome of mother with occurrence of type I diabetes in child,"Type I diabetes (T1D) is a rapidly increasing autoimmune disease especially in the Western countries and poses a serious global health problem. Incidence of T1D cannot be fully explained by genetic background, and environmental factors have been assumed to play a role. Environmental conditions and composition of human microbiome have been found to correlate with the incidence of T1D. We asked whether mothers’ prevalent vaginal microbiome could correlate with the incidence of T1D in child. To test this hypothesis, we collected samples of vaginal microbiomes from eight mothers that had at least one child with T1D (child age maximum of 11 years at the time of sampling), born with a vaginal delivery. Eight control mothers had child/children with vaginal delivery and no diabetic child/children. The microbiomes were studied by using 16S rRNA Ion Torrent high throughput sequencing. We found that composition of total and Lactobacillus microbiome was altered, and saw an indication that diversity of vaginal microbiomes of the mothers with a diabetic child could be higher. Based on these pilot observations, we strongly encourage a larger population study to verify whether mother vaginal microbiome diversity and composition are linked to the prevalence of T1D in children."
2,Prolonged grief related to COVID-19 deaths: Do we have to fear a steep rise in traumatic and disenfranchised griefs?,"The circumstances of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-related deaths embed multiple traumatic characteristics, alongside several external factors that can disenfranchise individual grief. In this context, severe forms of traumatic distress, guilt, somatization, regret, anger, and unspecific symptoms not yet included in prolonged grief disorder (PGD) criteria could emerge. This article (a) analyzes factors related to bereavement in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) proposes avenues for meaning-making practices to facilitate individual and collective mourning process; and (c) invites clinicians to pay attention to the traumatic characteristics of COVID-19-related deaths adopting a holistic approach of PGD clinical manifestations, as well as in evaluation and treatment of cases.

2,Speech spoken by familiar people is more resistant to interference by linguistically similar speech.,"Understanding speech in adverse conditions is affected by experience—a familiar voice is substantially more intelligible than an unfamiliar voice when competing speech is present, even if the content of the speech (the words) are controlled. This familiar-voice benefit is observed consistently, but its underpinnings are unclear: Do familiar voices simply attract more attention, are they inherently more intelligible because they have predictable acoustic characteristics, or are they more intelligible in a mixture because they are more resistant to interference from other sounds? We recruited pairs of native English-speaking participants who were friends or romantic couples. Participants reported words from closed-set English sentences (i.e., Oldenburg Matrix Test; Zokoll et al., 2013) spoken by a familiar talker (the participant’s partner) or an unfamiliar talker. We compared 3 masker conditions that are acoustically similar but differ in their demands: (1) English Oldenburg sentences; (2) Oldenburg sentences in a language incomprehensible to the listener (Russian or Spanish); and (3) unintelligible signal-correlated noise. We adaptively varied the target-to-masker ratio to obtain 50% speech reception thresholds. We observed a large (∼5 dB) familiar-voice benefit when the target and masker were both English sentences. This benefit was attenuated (to ∼2 dB) when the masker was in an incomprehensible language and disappeared when it was signal-correlated noise. These results suggest that familiar voices did not benefit intelligibility because they were more predictable or because they attracted greater attention, rather familiarity with a target voice reduced interference from maskers that are linguistically similar to the target.

3,Variations in endorsed and perceived mental health treatment stigma across U.S. higher education institutions.,"This study examines the association between 6 higher education institutional-level characteristics (institutional type, enrollment size, sector, housing, admissions selectivity, and graduation rate) and individual endorsed and perceived mental health treatment stigma scores among college students. We use data from the Healthy Minds Study during 2009–2017. The sample for this analysis includes 89,644 students at 105 unique institutions. We find a negative association between individual-level stigma scores and small enrollment institutions, private institutions, highly residential institutions, and institutions with the highest admissions selectivity and highest graduation rates. Moreover, these findings are generally similar across both individual measures of endorsed stigma and perceived stigma. Overall, our findings suggest that institutional environments where interactions are perhaps more frequent and personal (small enrollment institutions and highly residential institutions) are less likely to be associated with individual-level endorsements and perceptions of mental health treatment stigma.

2,Measuring divergent thinking originality with human raters and text-mining models: A psychometric comparison of methods.,"Within creativity research, interest and capability in utilizing text-mining models to quantify the Originality of participant responses to Divergent Thinking tasks has risen sharply over the last decade, with many extant studies fruitfully using such methods to uncover substantive patterns among creativity-relevant constructs. However, no systematic psychometric investigation of the reliability and validity of human-rated Originality scores, and scores from various freely available text-mining systems, exists in the literature. Here we conduct such an investigation with the Alternate Uses Task. We demonstrate that, despite their inherent subjectivity, human-rated Originality scores displayed the highest reliability at both the composite and latent factor levels. However, the text-mining system GloVe 840B was highly capable of approximating human-rated scores both in its measurement properties and its correlations to various creativity-related criteria including ideational Fluency, Elaboration, Openness, Intellect, and self-reported Creative Activities. We conclude that, in conjunction with other salient indicators of creative potential, text-mining models (and especially the GloVe 840B system) are capable of supporting reliable and valid inferences about Divergent Thinking. We offer an open-access module for researchers to apply these methods to their own data via our laboratory website (https://openscoring.du.edu/).

2,Patterns of family negativity in the perinatal period: Implications for mental health among Mexican-origin women.,"Negativity in the family environment during the perinatal period is likely to have detrimental effects on maternal well-being, especially among low-income ethnic minority mothers who are at increased risk for experiencing postpartum depressive symptoms. With a sample of 322 Mexican and Mexican American families, this study used latent class growth analysis to identify meaningful subgroups of women based on their perceived family negativity reported prenatally and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks postpartum. A 4-trajectory model of family negativity fit the data well: low-stable (58%), moderate-increasing (26%), high-decreasing (8%), and high-increasing (8%). Higher prenatal depressive symptomatology predicted membership in the moderate-increasing, high-decreasing, and high-increasing trajectories, relative to the low-stable trajectory. Findings suggest substantial heterogeneity in family negativity, identifying three significant growth patterns during the perinatal period with differential implications for maternal depressive symptomatology at 24 weeks and 12 months after delivery.

1,Temporal Variability and Stability of the Fecal Microbiome: The Multiethnic Cohort Study,"Background: Measurement reliability and biological stability need to be considered when developing sampling protocols for population-based fecal microbiome studies. \ Methods: Stool samples were collected biannually over a 2-year period and sequenced for the V1–V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene in 50 participants from the Multiethnic Cohort Study. We evaluated the temporal stability of the fecal microbiome on a community level with permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), as well as on taxa and diversity measures with intraclass correlation coefficients. \ Results: Interindividual differences were the predominant source of fecal microbiome variation, and variation within individual was driven more by changing abundances than by the complete loss or introduction of taxa. Phyla and diversity measures were reliable over the 2 years. Most genera were stable over time, although those with low abundances tended to be more dynamic. Reliability was lower among participants who used antibiotics, with the greatest difference seen in samples taken within 1 month of reported use. \ Conclusions: The fecal microbiome as a whole is stable over a 2-year period, although certain taxa may exhibit more temporal variability. \ Impact: When designing large epidemiologic studies, a single sample is sufficient to capture the majority of the variation in the fecal microbiome from 16S rRNA gene sequencing, while multiple samples may be needed for rare or less-abundant taxa."
2,Numeracy and memory for risk probabilities and risk outcomes depicted on cigarette warning labels.,"Objective: Greater numeracy is associated with higher likelihood to quit smoking. We examined whether numeracy supports learning of numeric health-risk information and, in turn, greater risk perceptions and quit intentions. Method: Adult smokers (N = 696) viewed text warnings with numeric risk information four times each in one of three warning-label types (text-only, low-emotion pictorial [i.e., with image], high-emotion pictorial). They completed posttest measures immediately or 6 weeks later. Emotional reactions to warnings were reported the second time participants viewed the warnings. Numeracy, memory for risk probabilities and risk outcomes, risk perceptions, and quit intentions were assessed postexposures. Results: Memory for risk probabilities and risk outcomes depended on warning-label type and posttest timing. Consistent with memory-consolidation theory, memory for high- versus low-emotion labels was lower immediately, but declined less for high-than low-emotion labels. Label memory was similar between conditions at 6 weeks. Numeracy predicted overall superior memory (especially for risk probabilities) controlling for health literacy and education. It also indirectly predicted greater risk perceptions and quit intentions via memory. In exploratory analyses, however, the superior recall of risk probabilities of smoking among those higher in numeracy was associated with lower risk perceptions. Conclusions: Numeracy is associated with superior risk memory, which relates to greater risk perceptions and quit intentions. More numerate and educated smokers may be better able to quit due to their superior learning of smoking’s risks. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,Identity development in early adulthood.,"This longitudinal study investigated identity development across early adulthood. To examine both stability and change in identity development, an explanatory mixed-methods design was employed. First, patterns of identity status development across early adulthood were examined, followed by an in-depth qualitative approach to understand more about the processes within identity status stability from the late 20s into the 30s. Analyses revealed group-level changes in identity status across ages 25 (Mage = 24.9, SD = 0.7), 29 (Mage = 29.3, SD = 0.6), and 33 (Mage = 33.3, SD = 0.5) among the 118 participants, with fewer individuals in moratorium and more in identity achievement in later years. Stable identity statuses with established commitments (identity achievement and foreclosure) were by far the most common patterns across early adulthood. To understand how early adults maintain their identity within these stable patterns, we employed longitudinal qualitative analyses of identity status interviews from ages 29 and 33. These analyses revealed 3 processes of identity development: approach to change (willingness to adjust and evolve previously established commitments), story integration (thematic and temporal integration, and metaexploration of previous identity work), and participation in a broader life context (identity expanding beyond personal aspirations). Together, these findings show that there is identity status change toward maturity across early adulthood and high stability within individual patterns. The findings also show that stable identity achievement facilitates further deepening within the three processes of identity development, and that stable foreclosure can be connected to both weakening and deepening in identity development.

3,Pregnancy and mental health of young homeless women.,"Pregnancy rates among young women who are homeless are significantly higher than rates among housed young women in the United States (J. M. Greene & C. L. Ringwalt, 1998). Yet, little research has addressed mental health or risk and resilience among young mothers who are homeless. Based on a sample from the Midwest Longitudinal Study of Homeless Adolescents, this study explores pregnancy and motherhood in unaccompanied homeless young women over a period of 3 years. The data are supplemented by in‐depth interviews with a subset of young women. Results show that almost half (46.4%) of sexually active young women who are homeless (n = 222, M age = 17.2) had been pregnant at baseline. Among those who stated they had children between Waves 2 and 13 (n = 90), only half reported caring for their children consistently over time, and one fifth reported never seeing their children. Of the participants with children in their care at the last interview (Wave 13), almost one third met criteria for lifetime major depressive episode, lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder, and lifetime drug abuse, and half met criteria for lifetime antisocial personality disorder. Twelve‐month diagnoses are also reported. The impacts of homelessness on maternal and child outcomes are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,An exploratory study of mental health and HIV risk behavior among drug-using rural women in jail.,"Objective: Rural women, particularly those in the criminal justice system, are at risk for HIV related to the increasing prevalence of injection drug use as well as limited services. Research on HIV risk correlates, including drug use and mental health, has primarily focused on urban women incarcerated in prisons. The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine dual HIV risk by 3 different mental health problems (depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) among drug-using women in rural jails. Method: This study involved random selection, screening, and face-to-face interviews with 136 women in 1 Appalachian state. Analyses focused on the relationship between mental health and HIV risk. Results: Nearly 80% of women self-reported symptoms of depression, and more than 60% endorsed symptoms consistent with anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Mental health significantly correlated with severity of certain types of drug use, as well as risky sexual activity. In addition, for women experiencing anxiety and PTSD, injection drug use moderated the relationship between mental health and risky sexual activity. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Based on these rates of drug use, mental health problems, and the emergence of injection drug use in rural Appalachia, the need to explore the relationships between these issues among vulnerable and understudied populations, such as rural women, is critical. Because of service limitations in rural communities, criminal justice venues such as jails provide opportune settings for screening, assessment, and intervention for drug use, mental health, and HIV education and prevention.

3,Relational antecedents and social implications of the emotion of empathy: Evidence from three studies.,"Despite emotion researchers’ strong interest in empathy and its implications for prosocial functioning, surprisingly few studies have examined parent–child attachment as a context for early origins of empathy in young children. Consequently, empirical evidence on links among children’s attachment, empathy, and prosociality is thin and inconsistent. We examined such links in 2 longitudinal studies of community families (Family Study, N = 101 mothers, fathers, and children, 14 to 80 months; Parent–Child Study, mothers and children, N = 108, 15 to 45 months) and a study of low-income, diverse mothers and toddlers (Play Study, N = 186, 30 months). Children’s security was assessed in Strange Situation in infancy and rated by observers and mothers using Attachment Q-Set at toddler age. Children’s empathy was observed in scripted probes that involved parental simulated distress. Children’s prosociality was rated by parents (Family Study, Play Study). Security with mothers related to higher empathy. For mother- and father–child dyads, security moderated the path from empathy to prosociality. For insecure children, but not secure ones, variations in empathy related to prosociality. Insecure and unempathic children were particularly low in prosociality.

1,Ecological and Evolutionary Forces Shaping Microbial Diversity in the Human Intestine,"The human gut is populated with as many as 100 trillion cells, whose collective genome, the microbiome, is a reflection of evolutionary selection pressures acting at the level of the host and at the level of the microbial cell.

2,Physical fitness and age-related differences in cognition and cortical thickness in young adulthood.,"The association between physical fitness and age-related differences in cognition and brain structure has been studied fairly extensively during development and aging, yet comparatively less in young adulthood. The current study examined 1,195 young adults aged 22 to 36 (54% female; 67% Caucasian) to better understand associations between physical fitness—grip strength and submaximal cardiovascular endurance—and age-related differences in executive function (EF), memory, and average cortical thickness. EF, memory, and cortical thickness were negatively associated with age, and higher endurance was positively associated with EF and memory. Neither physical fitness measure associated with cortical thinning. To follow-up on these analyses, data from monozygotic (n = 149 pairs) and dizygotic (n = 93 pairs) twins were used to estimate the degree to which heritability versus environment might contribute to the observed associations between cognition and endurance. Environmental effects shared by monozygotic and dizygotic twins alike were estimated to account for roughly 50% of the correlation between endurance and cognition (EF and memory). Heritability and nonshared environmental effects were inconsistent across EF and memory. Overall, these findings suggest an association between cardiovascular endurance and age-related differences in cognition in young adulthood and that these associations may be independent of cortical thinning. Whereas there was consistent evidence for a moderate contribution of the shared environment, there was limited and inconsistent evidence for a role of heritability.

1,Nanoparticle microarray for high-throughput microbiome metabolomics using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry,"A high-throughput matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI)-MS-based metabolomics platform was developed using a pre-fabricated microarray of nanoparticles and organic matrices. Selected organic matrices, inorganic nanoparticle (NP) suspensions, and sputter coated metal NPs, as well as various additives, were tested for metabolomics analysis of the turkey gut microbiome. Four NPs and one organic matrix were selected as the optimal matrix set: α-cyano-4-hydroycinnamic acid, Fe3O4 and Au NPs in positive ion mode with 10 mM sodium acetate, and Cu and Ag NPs in negative ion mode with no additive. Using this set of five matrices, over two thousand unique metabolite features were reproducibly detected across intestinal samples from turkeys fed a diet amended with therapeutic or sub-therapeutic antibiotics (200 g/ton or 50 g/ton bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD), respectively), or non-amended feed. Among the thousands of unique features, 56 of them were chemically identified using MALDI-MS/MS, with the help of in-parallel liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS analysis.

3,Mental health outcomes of drug conflict among university students at the U.S.–Mexico border.,"The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate to what extent young adults with close ties to Mexico were at greater risk for self-reported negative mental health outcomes than comparison groups during drug-related armed conflict from 2008 through 2012, and the effect of type and number of traumatic events on mental health outcomes. Using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, 202 university students living in the El Paso–Ciudad Juárez border region were surveyed for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. Students with close ties to Mexico reported symptoms of anxiety and posttraumatic stress at significantly higher rates compared with those without connection to Mexico, but there was no significant difference in rates of depression. Although more than a third of participants reported experiencing 5 or more traumatic events connected with the drug war, being confined to home had the most significant effect. Frequency of traumatic events reported by students as well as rates of anxiety and posttraumatic stress symptoms were higher among students with greater connection to Mexico. Rates of clinically-significant depressive symptoms among all students were higher than expected for U.S. adults but comparable with all U.S. college students. This study presents important new data on the mental health effects of Mexico’s drug war. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,"Food additives, contaminants and other minor components: effects on human gut microbiota—a review","Gut bacteria play an important role in several metabolic processes and human diseases, such as obesity and accompanying co-morbidities, such as fatty liver disease, insulin resistance/diabetes, and cardiovascular events. Among other factors, dietary patterns, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and non-dietary factors, such as stress, age, exercise, and climatic conditions, can dramatically impact the human gut microbiota equilibrium and diversity. However, the effect of minor food constituents, including food additives and trace contaminants, on human gut microbiota has received less attention. Consequently, the present review aimed to provide an objective perspective of the current knowledge regarding the impacts of minor food constituents on human gut microbiota and consequently, on human health."
1,Analysis of the Pulmonary Microbiome Composition of Legionella pneumophila-Infected Patients,"The analysis of the lung microbiome composition is a field of research that recently emerged. It gained great interest in pulmonary diseases such as pneumonia since the microbiome seems to be involved in host immune responses, inflammation, and protection against pathogens. Thus, it is possible that the microbial communities living in the lungs play a role in the outcome and severity of lung infections such as Legionella-caused pneumonia and in the response to antibiotic therapy. In this chapter, all steps necessary for the characterization of the bacterial and fungal fraction of the lung microbiome using high-throughput sequencing approaches are explained, starting from the selection of clinical samples to the analysis of the taxonomic composition, diversity, and ecology of the microbiome."
2,Source retrieval under cueing: Dissociated effects on accuracy versus confidence.,"During recognition memory decisions, external hints or cues alter the accuracy and confidence of correct rejections (valid > uncued > invalid). In contrast, although hits show analogous accuracy effects, hit confidence remains largely unaffected by cue validity. Prior research suggested this confidence validity dissociation (CVD) may depend upon the presence of recollection during hits. If so, confidence during other recollection dependent tasks such as source memory should show the same insensitivity to cue validity, despite clear changes in accuracy. We tested this in 5 source-memory experiments manipulating encoding location (left or right, Experiments 1, 2, and 5) or study list (first or second, Experiments 3 and 4). At test, memoranda were preceded by predictive arrow cues (75% valid/25% invalid) indicating the likely prior location or list of the source memory probe. Cue validity affected accuracy in all 5 Experiments. Nonetheless, mean confidence for both correct and incorrect source judgments was unaffected by cue validity. These data demonstrate that the subjective confidence of source attributions can become untethered from accuracy when external influences are present. Analyses of previously published recognition data elucidated this finding by showing that confidence is not affected by cue validity for items recognized as “old” regardless of accuracy (i.e., hits and false alarms). However, confidence is affected by cue validity for items judged “new” regardless of accuracy (i.e., correct rejections and misses). We suggest this dissociation depends upon the retrieval schemas and decision heuristics that observers use when concluding items arise from candidate experiences held in mind.

2,Psychotherapists’ vicarious traumatization during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"During the COVID-19, psychotherapists are often exposed to traumatic material in their sessions, potentially leading to vicarious traumatization. We surveyed 339 therapists about their professional practices and experiences during the pandemic. Results showed that on average therapists experienced moderate levels of vicarious trauma, whereas about 15% experienced high levels of vicarious trauma. A higher level of vicarious trauma was associated with younger age, less clinical experience, and negative online treatment experiences. The results imply a need for personal and professional support for therapists working remotely amid a global health crisis. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,When work is your passenger: Understanding the relationship between work and commuting safety behaviors.,"For those who commute to and from work on a daily basis, this is an activity that requires attention to both what one is doing and the environment, in order for the commute to be done safely. Although research has shown that work can spill over into home and other nonwork domains, little attention has been paid to the impact that work may have on the transition time between one’s work and nonwork domains. The present study sought to examine the relationship between end-of-day job strain and commuting stress with the safety of one’s commute through the experience of work-related rumination. Data were collected via daily diaries administered over 2 working weeks (i.e., 10 days) from employees (N = 106) who worked full-time and commuted by private vehicle on a daily basis. Using a daily diary approach allowed for the examination of intraindividual variability in the study constructs of interest, in an effort to understand the dynamics of the hypothesized phenomena. Results indicate that at the intraindividual level, job strain spills over to impact safety behaviors while commuting, mediated by the experiences of work-related affective rumination, and commuting stress impacts safety behaviors during the commute. Findings suggest that the spillover between one’s work experiences into the commute have the potential to impair the safety of employees outside the workplace. Future research and implications for practice are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,The effect of intoxication on free-pour accuracy following skills training.,"Reducing risk associated with college student drinking is a major public health concern. The free-pour assessment has the potential to inform interventions aimed at reducing risks associated with college student drinking. Yet, few studies have assessed conditions that influence pouring abilities, and no identified studies have assessed pouring behavior under the influence of alcohol. Participants trained to pour a standard drink of beer received a dose of alcohol (n = 7) or a placebo dose (n = 6) and repeated free-pours along the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) curve. Results suggested that participants were able to pour a standard drink of beer within the 10% training criterion range (12 oz) after a stimulus fading training procedure. Further, free-poured ounces were not subject to acute tolerance, as the majority of free-pours in the alcohol dose group (85.8% of pours) and the placebo dose group (83.3%) was within the training criteria. These data suggest that free-pouring a standard drink of beer is a trainable skill that persists despite a moderate dose of alcohol. Future studies should examine if skills training of other protective skills in the context of elevated BAC reduces the risks associated with intoxication among college students.

3,Mode of birth and social inequalities in health: The effect of maternal education and access to hospital care on cesarean delivery,"Access to health care is an important factor in explaining health inequalities. This study focuses on the issue of access to health care as a driving force behind the social discrepancies in cesarean delivery using data from 707 newborn children in the 2006–2011 birth cohorts of the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). Data on individual birth outcomes are linked to hospital data using extracts of the quality assessment reports of nearly all German hospitals. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to assess hospital service clusters within a 20-km radius buffer around mother׳s homes. Logistic regression models adjusting for maternal characteristics indicate that the likelihood to deliver by a cesarean section increases for the least educated women when they face constraints with regard to access to hospital care. No differences between the education groups are observed when access to obstetric care is high, thus a high access to hospital care seems to balance out health inequalities that are related to differences in education. The results emphasize the importance of focusing on unequal access to hospital care in explaining differences in birth outcomes."
3,"Planned home birth: benefits, risks, and opportunities","While the number of women in developed countries who plan a home birth is low, the number has increased over the past decade in the US, and there is evidence that more women would choose this option if it were readily available. Rates of planned home birth range from 0.1% in Sweden to 20% in the Netherlands, where home birth has always been an integrated part of the maternity system. Benefits of planned home birth include lower rates of maternal morbidity, such as postpartum hemorrhage, and perineal lacerations, and lower rates of interventions such as episiotomy, instrumental vaginal birth, and cesarean birth. Women who have a planned home birth have high rates of satisfaction related to home being a more comfortable environment and feeling more in control of the experience. While maternal outcomes related to planned birth at home have been consistently positive within the literature, reported neonatal outcomes during planned home birth are more variable. While the majority of investigations of planned home birth compared with hospital birth have found no difference in intrapartum fetal deaths, neonatal deaths, low Apgar scores, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, there have been reports in the US, as well as a meta-analysis, that indicated more adverse neonatal outcomes associated with home birth. There are multiple challenges associated with research designs focused on planned home birth, in part because conducting randomized controlled trials is not feasible. This report will review current research studies published between 2004 and 2014 related to maternal and neonatal outcomes of planned home birth, and discuss strengths, limitations, and opportunities regarding planned home birth."
1,The Human Microbiome: Our Second Genome,"The human genome has been referred to as the blueprint of human biology. In this review we consider an essential but largely ignored overlay to that blueprint, the human microbiome, which is composed of those microbes that live in and on our bodies. The human microbiome is a source of genetic diversity, a modifier of disease, an essential component of immunity, and a functional entity that influences metabolism and modulates drug interactions. Characterization and analysis of the human microbiome have been greatly catalyzed by advances in genomic technologies. We discuss how these technologies have shaped this emerging field of study and advanced our understanding of the human microbiome. We also identify future challenges, many of which are common to human genetic studies, and predict that in the future, analyzing genetic variation and risk of human disease will sometimes necessitate the integration of human and microbial genomic data sets."

1,"Serotonin and tryptophan metabolites, autoantibodies and gut microbiome in APECED","Objective \ Intestinal autoimmunity with gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction has been shown in patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). Patients lack entero-endocrine (EE) cells and have circulating autoantibodies (Aabs) against critical enzymes in serotonin (5-HT) biosynthesis. \  \ Design \ We sought to determine the serum levels of 5-HT, tryptophan (Trp) metabolites and L-DOPA in 37 Finnish APECED patients and to correlate their abundance with the presence of TPH and AADC Aabs, GI dysfunction and depressive symptoms. We also performed an exploratory analysis of the gut microbiome. \  \ Methods \ Serum 5-HT, L-DOPA and Trp metabolite levels were determined by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). TPH and AADC Aabs were measured by ELISA. Depression was assessed with a structured RBDI questionnaire. The V3–V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were sequenced for gut microbiome exploration. \  \ Results \ Serum 5-HT levels were significantly decreased (130 ± 131 nmol/L vs 686 ± 233 nmol/L, P < 0.0001) in APECED patients with TPH-1 (±AADC) Aabs compared to controls and patients with only AADC Aabs. Reduced 5-HT levels correlated with constipation. The genus Escherichia/Shigella was overrepresented in the intestinal microbiome. No correlation between serum Trp, 5-HT or l-DOPA levels and the RBDI total score, fatigue or sleep disorders was found. \  \ Conclusions \ This exploratory study found low serum levels of 5-HT to be associated with constipation and the presence of TPH-1 and AADC Aabs, but not with symptoms of depression. Hence, serum 5-HT, TPH1 and AADC Aabs should be determined in APECED patients presenting with GI symptoms."
1,The effect of maxillary sinus antrostomy size on the sinus microbiome,"Background The optimal maxillary antrostomy size to surgically treat sinusitis is not well known. In this study, we examined clinical metrics of disease severity and symptom scores, measured secreted inflammatory markers, and characterized the sinus microbiome to determine if there were significant differences in outcome between different maxillary ostial sizes. Methods Prospective randomized, single-blinded clinical trial enrolling 12 individuals diagnosed with recurrent acute or chronic rhinosinusitis. Each patient was blinded and randomized to receive minimal maxillary ostial dilation via balloon sinuplasty on 1 side vs a mega-antrostomy on the contralateral side. Data collected included symptom scores (20-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test [SNOT-20]), endoscopy, and radiologic Lund-Mackay scores. During surgery and at their postoperative visit swabs were obtained from each maxillary sinus, and 16S DNA and inflammatory cytokine levels analyzed. The use of each patient as their own control allowed us to minimize confounding variables. Results There was statistically significant improvement in SNOT-20 symptom scores postoperatively in all patients. There were no significant differences between maxillary ostial size in postoperative endoscopy scores, cytokine profile, or bacterial burden. There were statistically significant differences in relative postoperative abundance of Staphylococcus, Lactococcus, and Cyanobacteria between the mega-antrostomy and mini-antrostomy. Conclusions The method used in surgical maxillary antrostomies had no effect on endoscopy scores or cytokine profiles. Microbiome analysis determined significant differences between the different antrostomy sizes in postoperative Staphylococcus, Lactococcus, and Cyanobacteria abundance. The clinical significance of these changes in the sinus microbiome are not known but may be a result of increased access to postoperative sinonasal irrigations."
2,Threat reduces value-driven but not salience-driven attentional capture.,"What we direct our attention to is strongly influenced by both bottom-up and top-down processes. Moreover, the control of attention is biased by prior learning, such that attention is automatically captured by stimuli previously associated with either reward or threat. It is unknown whether value-oriented and threat-oriented mechanisms of selective information processing function independently of one another, or whether they interact with each other in the selection process. Here, we introduced the threat of electric shock into the value-driven attentional capture paradigm to examine whether the experience of threat influences the attention capturing quality of previously reward-associated stimuli. The results showed that value-driven attentional capture was blunted by the experience of threat. This contrasts with previous reports of threat potentiating attentional capture by physically salient stimuli, which we replicate here. Our findings demonstrate that threat selectively interferes with value-based but not salience-based attentional priority, consistent with a competitive relationship between value-based and threat-based information processing.

1,Quantitative microbiome profiling links gut community variation to microbial load,"Current sequencing-based analyses of faecal microbiota quantify microbial taxa and metabolic pathways as fractions of the sample sequence library generated by each analysis1,2. Although these relative approaches permit detection of disease-associated microbiome variation, they are limited in their ability to reveal the interplay between microbiota and host health3,4. Comparative analyses of relative microbiome data cannot provide information about the extent or directionality of changes in taxa abundance or metabolic potential5. If microbial load varies substantially between samples, relative profiling will hamper attempts to link microbiome features to quantitative data such as physiological parameters or metabolite concentrations5,6. Saliently, relative approaches ignore the possibility that altered overall microbiota abundance itself could be a key identifier of a disease-associated ecosystem configuration7. To enable genuine characterization of host–microbiota interactions, microbiome research must exchange ratios for counts4,8,9. Here we build a workflow for the quantitative microbiome profiling of faecal material, through parallelization of amplicon sequencing and flow cytometric enumeration of microbial cells. We observe up to tenfold differences in the microbial loads of healthy individuals and relate this variation to enterotype differentiation. We show how microbial abundances underpin both microbiota variation between individuals and covariation with host phenotype. Quantitative profiling bypasses compositionality effects in the reconstruction of gut microbiota interaction networks and reveals that the taxonomic trade-off between Bacteroides and Prevotella is an artefact of relative microbiome analyses. Finally, we identify microbial load as a key driver of observed microbiota alterations in a cohort of patients with Crohn’s disease10, here associated with a low-cell-count Bacteroides enterotype (as defined through relative profiling)11,12."
2,Do you feel like I do? A study of spontaneous and deliberate emotion sharing and understanding between artists and perceivers of installation art.,"Humans appear naturally inclined to both broadcasting and to perceiving each other’s emotional experiences. Especially in the area of empathy or emotion contagion, studies have routinely documented our ability to respond to others’ affective states, often via faces or bodies. This can occur on an intellectual level of perceiving emotion signs or can involve actually feeling how others appear to be feeling or mirroring responses with our own brains and physiology. However, while well-documented in interpersonal studies, can this process occur in the absence of another human? Specifically, with art or music, a longstanding argument involves the potential for these media to act as a proxy for the artist, providing an interface whereby one can “feel in” to share an emotional connection. For visual art, however, this process has almost never been empirically recorded. Here, we introduce a paradigm wherein we assessed working artists’ emotional experiences and intentions as they produced installation artworks and then assessed resulting emotions and understanding of viewers. We find that in some cases (2 of 3 artworks) viewers did consistently feel more emotions that the artist had intended, they also spontaneously reported feeling similar emotion patterns as those reported by the artists when making, regardless of whether these had been intended. With all 3 artworks, viewers also showed ability to guess the emotion-transmission intentions of artists. Success at emotion sharing and at feeling intended emotions also positively related to ratings (i.e., goodness) of the art. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,Coherence between subjective experience and physiology in emotion: Individual differences and implications for well-being.,"Emotion theorists have characterized emotions as involving coherent responding across various emotion response systems (e.g., covariation of subjective experience and physiology). Greater response system coherence has been theorized to promote well-being, yet very little research has tested this assumption. The current study examined whether individuals with greater coherence between physiology and subjective experience of emotion report greater well-being. We also examined factors that may predict the magnitude of coherence, such as emotion intensity, cognitive reappraisal, and expressive suppression. Participants (N = 63) completed self-report measures of well-being, expressive suppression, and cognitive reappraisal. They then watched a series of emotionally evocative film clips designed to elicit positive and negative emotion. During the films, participants continuously rated their emotional experience using a rating dial, and their autonomic physiological responses were recorded. Time-lagged cross-correlations were used to calculate within-participant coherence between intensity of emotional experience (ranging from neutral to very negative or very positive) and physiology (composite of cardiac interbeat interval, skin conductance, ear pulse transit time, finger pulse transit time and amplitude, systolic and diastolic blood pressure). Results indicated that individuals with greater coherence reported greater well-being. Coherence was highest during the most emotionally intense film and among individuals who reported lower expressive suppression. However, coherence was not associated with reappraisal. These findings provide support for the idea that greater emotion coherence promotes well-being and also shed light on factors that are associated with the magnitude of coherence.

3,National identity and public attitudes toward multiculturalism in Canada: Testing the indirect effect via perceived collective threat.,"This article integrates research on national identity and collective threat to examine how these 2 factors jointly contribute to the formation of multicultural ideology in Canada. Specifically, this article argues that ethnic and civic forms of national identity are associated with levels of perceived collective threat, thereby indirectly affecting multicultural attitudes (national identity → collective threat → multicultural attitudes). Results of structural equation modeling analyses indicated that (a) ethnic national identity is positively, and civic national identity is negatively, associated with collective threat; (b) the direct effect of ethnic national identity on multicultural attitudes disappears when collective threat is taken into account; and (c) the relationship between ethnic–civic national identity and multicultural attitudes is significantly mediated by collective threat. These findings imply that a shift from an ethnic to a civic (or ethnoculturally thinner) conception of nationhood reduces levels of outgroup threat and thereby indirectly generates positive multicultural ideology.

1,Altered Microbiome in Patients With Cirrhosis and Complications,"<p>In patients with cirrhosis, the gut microbiome are affected by multiple gut and systemic alterations. These changes lead to dysbiosis in the microbiota of different parts of the body, resulting in inflammation. The constant immune stimulation resulting in part from dysbiosis is associated with morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. Dysbiosis as a dynamic event worsens with decompensation such as with hepatic encephalopathy, infections or acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). These microbial patterns could be applied as diagnostic and prognostic measures in cirrhosis in the outpatient and inpatient setting. Current therapies for cirrhosis have differing impacts on gut microbial composition and functionality. Dietary modifications and the oral cavity have emerged as newer targetable factors to modulate the microbiome, which could affect inflammation and, potentially improve outcomes. Additionally, fecal microbial transplant is being increasingly studied to provide compositional and functional modulation of the microbiome. Ultimately, a combination of targeted therapies may be needed to provide an optimal gut milieu to improve outcomes in cirrhosis.</p>"
3,Biodiversity loss and its impact on humanity,"The most unique feature of Earth is the existence of life, and the most extraordinary feature of life is its diversity. Approximately 9 million types of plants, animals, protists and fungi inhabit the Earth. So, too, do 7 billion people. Two decades ago, at the first Earth Summit, the vast majority of the world’s nations declared that human actions were dismantling the Earth’s ecosystems, eliminating genes, species and biological traits at an alarming rate. This observation led to the question of how such loss of biological diversity will alter the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide society with the goods and services needed to prosper."
2,Coparental discord and children’s behavior problems: Children’s negative family representations as an explanatory mechanism.,"This study examined children’s insecure representations of the family as a mechanism accounting for the association between coparental discord and children’s externalizing problems in a diverse sample of 243 preschool children (mean [M] age = 4.60 years). The results from a multimethod, multi-informant, prospective design indicated that coparental discord was indirectly related to children’s externalizing behaviors through their insecure representations of the family. Higher levels of coparental discord were specifically linked with more insecure representations of the family, which in turn predicted higher levels of externalizing behaviors 2 years later. These pathways remained robust even after considering the roles of general family adversity, child gender, and family income per capita as predictors in the analyses.

2,Do visible semantic primes preactivate lexical representations?,"Considerable research effort has been devoted to investigating semantic priming effects, particularly, the locus of those effects. Semantically related primes might activate their target’s lexical representation (through automatic spreading activation at short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), or through generation of words expected to follow the prime at longer SOAs). Alternately, semantically related primes might aid responding after target identification (i.e., postlexically). In contrast, masked orthographic priming effects appear to be lexical and automatic. Lexical processing of targets is facilitated by orthographically similar nonword primes and often inhibited by orthographically similar word primes (Davis & Lupker, 2006). Using the lexical-decision task (LDT), we found additivity between the facilitative effects of visible semantic primes and the facilitative effects of masked orthographically similar nonword primes at long and short SOAs, consistent with a postlexical locus of the semantic priming effects. Also consistent with this conclusion, semantic primes affected the skew of the distribution (larger effects on longer latency trials), whereas masked orthographic primes did not. In a final experiment, visible primes that were semantically related to the masked orthographic word primes did not make those primes more effective lexical inhibitors of orthographically similar targets (independent of SOA). Taken together, our findings suggest that the impact of a semantic prime is not to increase the lexical activation of related concepts. Rather, they suggest that the locus of semantic priming effects in LDTs is postlexical, in that discovering the existence of a relationship between the prime and target biases participants to make a “word” response.

1,Partial restoration of the microbiota of cesarean-born infants via vaginal microbial transfer,"Exposure of newborns to the maternal vaginal microbiotais interrupted with cesarean birthing. Babies delivered by cesarean section (C-section) acquire a microbiota that differs from that of vaginally delivered infants, and C-section delivery has been associated with increased risk for immune and metabolic disorders. Here we conducted a pilot study in which infants delivered by C-section were exposed to maternal vaginal fluids at birth. Similarly to vaginally delivered babies, the gut, oral and skin bacterial communities of these newborns during the first 30 d of life was enriched in vaginal bacteriawhich were underrepresented in unexposed C-sectiondelivered infantsand the microbiome similarity to those of vaginally delivered infants was greater in oral and skin samples than in anal samples. Although the long-term health consequences of restoring the microbiota of C-sectiondelivered infants remain unclear, our results demonstrate that vaginal microbes can be partially restored at birth in C-sectiondelivered babies."
3,From psychological strain to disconnectedness: A two-factor model theory of suicide.,"This editorial asserts that neither Durkheim’s social integration theory nor Joiner’s interpersonal theory explains the cause of suicide. Instead, the theories illustrate the facilitations of suicide or of the immune system against suicide. The theories might account for the conditions that are sufficient for suicide, but we still need to find the condition that is necessary for suicide. If increasing social integration is to strengthen the immune system (to decrease the sufficient conditions) against suicide, what is the necessary condition (cause) for suicide? Where did the suicidal virus or disease come from? In other words, what makes a person determined to die to begin with? To sociologists, the answers can only be found in the social structure, the environment, and the life of those individuals. The strain theory of suicide postulates that psychological strains usually precede a suicidal thought or determination. The author describes four sources of psychological strain that may cause suicidal ideation. Each of the four types of strain is derived from specific sources. A source of strain must consist of at least two conflicting social facts. If the two social facts are noncontradictory, there should be no strain. The four strain sources are (1) differential values, (2) reality versus aspiration, (3) relative deprivation, and (4) deficient coping. The author proposes a two-factor model theory of suicide, which is a synthesis of the strain and integration theories. To test the two-factor model theory of suicide, large population data need to be obtained with sophisticated measurements of the critical variables for a comprehensive examination of the different roles played by psychological strains and disconnectedness/capability in suicidal behavior.

3,Sustaining a positive altruistic identity in humanitarian aid work: A qualitative case study.,"This case study explores the interpersonal and intrapersonal experiences of a single individual who spent more than 35 years in humanitarian aid work. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, one superordinate theme, altruistic identity (AI), emerges. On return home following a humanitarian mission, AI requires (a) strong perception of empathic validation for intimate reintegration and (b) self-acceptance of personal involvement. However, AI disruption is related to (a) a perception of rejection or weak empathic validation for intimate reintegration and (b) self-blame leading to isolation from intimate others. With AI disruption, validation is alternately sought from humanitarian colleagues and/or by returning to the field. Results suggest that postmission reintegration processes are important determinants of psychological well-being. The authors also discuss the organization's role in addressing the psychosocial care of their staff on return from mission to reduce long-term social disruption and psychological distress.

2,Triadic interaction and gestural communication: Hierarchical and child-centered interactions of rural and urban Gujarati (Indian) caregivers and 9-month-old infants.,"In this study 9-month-old infants in rural and urban Gujarat, India were compared in how frequently and in which way they engage in triadic interactions. It was assumed that urban caregivers would engage in a child-centered interaction style, frequently creating triadic interactions and following infants’ signals. It was also expected that they would engage in more gestural communication in line with results on young infants often being involved in distal interactions. Rural caregivers were assumed to engage in a hierarchical interaction style in which the caregiver directs the interactions. It was expected that they would engage more in bodily ways of communicating as young infants in these communities often experience large amounts of proximal interactions. Infants were observed in everyday situations to assess their everyday engagement in triadic interactions and experience with gestures. Additionally, infants’ mothers were asked to show their children something distant to assess how triadic attention is created. These interactions were video recorded and analyzed in terms of gestures and bodily behaviors. The results indicate that urban infants experience more triadic interactions and have caregivers who are more likely to follow their initiatives than rural infants. In the observations, urban caregivers also used gestures more frequently than rural caregivers. For rural infants the results are less clear with some indications that caregivers directed their attention more, particularly using their bodies. These differences were only apparent in the video-recorded situations. Implications for infants’ further development are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,Exploring the Human Microbiome: The Potential Future Role of Next-Generation Sequencing in Disease Diagnosis and Treatment,"The interaction between the human microbiome and immune system has an effect on several human metabolic functions and impacts our well-being. Additionally, the interaction between humans and microbes can also play a key role in determining the wellness or disease status of the human body. Dysbiosis is related to a plethora of diseases, including skin, inflammatory, metabolic, and neurological disorders. A better understanding of the host-microbe interaction is essential for determining the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of these ailments. The significance of the microbiome on host health has led to the emergence of new therapeutic approaches focused on the prescribed manipulation of the host microbiome, either by removing harmful taxa or reinstating missing beneficial taxa and the functional roles they perform. Culturing large numbers of microbial taxa in the laboratory is problematic at best, if not impossible. Consequently, this makes it very difficult to comprehensively catalogue the individual members comprising a specific microbiome, as well as understanding how microbial communities function and influence host-pathogen interactions. Recent advances in sequencing technologies and computational tools have allowed an increasing number of metagenomic studies to be performed. These studies have provided key insights into the human microbiome and a host of other microbial communities in other environments. In the present review, the role of the microbiome as a therapeutic agent and its significance in human health and disease is discussed. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies for surveying host-microbe interactions are also discussed. Additionally, the correlation between the composition of the microbiome and infectious diseases as described in previously reported studies is covered as well. Lastly, recent advances in state-of-the-art bioinformatics software, workflows, and applications for analysing metagenomic data are summarized."
2,A toolbox approach to improving the measurement of attention control.,"Cognitive tasks that produce reliable and robust effects at the group level often fail to yield reliable and valid individual differences. An ongoing debate among attention researchers is whether conflict resolution mechanisms are task-specific or domain-general, and the lack of correlation between most attention measures seems to favor the view that attention control is not a unitary concept. We have argued that the use of difference scores, particularly in reaction time (RT), is the primary cause of null and conflicting results at the individual differences level, and that methodological issues with existing tasks preclude making strong theoretical conclusions. The present article is an empirical test of this view in which we used a toolbox approach to develop and validate new tasks hypothesized to reflect attention processes. Here, we administered existing, modified, and new attention tasks to over 400 participants (final N = 396). Compared with the traditional Stroop and flanker tasks, performance on the accuracy-based measures was more reliable, had stronger intercorrelations, formed a more coherent latent factor, and had stronger associations to measures of working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. Further, attention control fully accounted for the relationship between working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. These results show that accuracy-based measures can be better suited to individual differences investigations than traditional RT tasks, particularly when the goal is to maximize prediction. We conclude that attention control is a unitary concept. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,An Underground Revolution: Biodiversity and Soil Ecological Engineering for Agricultural Sustainability,"Soil organisms are an integral component of ecosystems, but their activities receive little recognition in agricultural management strategies. Here we synthesize the potential of soil organisms to enhance ecosystem service delivery and demonstrate that soil biodiversity promotes multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously (i.e., ecosystem multifunctionality). We apply the concept of ecological intensification to soils and we develop strategies for targeted exploitation of soil biological traits. We compile promising approaches to enhance agricultural sustainability through the promotion of soil biodiversity and targeted management of soil community composition. We present soil ecological engineering as a concept to generate human land-use systems, which can serve immediate human needs while minimizing environmental impacts."

3,Coping with post-ceasefire violence.,"Much has been said about the specific psychological, physical, social, and cultural consequences of years of violent conflict and war, however little is known about the effects of post-ceasefire violence. In this paper, we take the individual case as unit of analysis and consider how two women cope with post-ceasefire violence in Northern Ireland. Quantitative as well as qualitative data show that while, on the surface, these women seem to ‘put on a brave face’, their psychological health is deeply affected by personal circumstances and fluctuating levels of post-ceasefire violence. This micro-level analysis is discussed in relation to the assertion in previous psychological literature that coping with the conflict in Northern Ireland was predominantly based on resilience, avoidance, and denial (Cairns & Wilson, 1984). Findings are discussed from a behaviour analytic view. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
2,Low-income Latino mothers’ and fathers’ control strategies and toddler compliance.,"We explored children’s compliance to their mothers’ and fathers’ control strategies in a sample of 49 Latino toddlers and their immigrant parents during a cleanup task. We report 3 sets of findings. First, both mothers and fathers primarily used direct and indirect commands to elicit compliance. Second, there was no difference in the type of control strategies mothers and fathers used with their daughters versus sons. Mothers who used praise and indirect commands had children who complied more, whereas mothers who used direct commands and incentives had children who were less compliant. Toddlers were more compliant to their fathers than mothers, and girls were more compliant to their mothers than were boys. Third, mothers who used more direct control strategies also strongly endorsed the value of respeto. These findings highlight the importance of examining the variation in Latino mothers’ and fathers’ control strategies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,The benefits associated with volunteering among seniors: A critical review and recommendations for future research.,"There is an urgent need to identify lifestyle activities that reduce functional decline and dementia associated with population aging. The goals of this article are to review critically the evidence on the benefits associated with formal volunteering among older adults, propose a theoretical model of how volunteering may reduce functional limitations and dementia risk, and offer recommendations for future research. Database searches identified 113 papers on volunteering benefits in older adults, of which 73 were included. Data from descriptive, cross-sectional, and prospective cohort studies, along with 1 randomized controlled trial, most consistently reveal that volunteering is associated with reduced symptoms of depression, better self-reported health, fewer functional limitations, and lower mortality. The extant evidence provides the basis for a model proposing that volunteering increases social, physical, and cognitive activity (to varying degrees depending on characteristics of the volunteer placement) which, through biological and psychological mechanisms, leads to improved functioning; we further propose that these volunteering-related functional improvements should be associated with reduced dementia risk. Recommendations for future research are that studies (a) include more objective measures of psychosocial, physical, and cognitive functioning; (b) integrate qualitative and quantitative methods in prospective study designs; (c) explore further individual differences in the benefits associated with volunteering; (d) include occupational analyses of volunteers’ specific jobs in order to identify their social, physical, and cognitive complexity; (e) investigate the independent versus interactive health benefits associated with volunteering relative to engagement in other forms of activity; and (f) examine the relationship between volunteering and dementia risk.

3,The microbiome of the built environment and mental health,"The microbiome of the built environment (MoBE) is a relatively new area of study. While some knowledge has been gained regarding impacts of the MoBE on the human microbiome and disease vulnerability, there is little knowledge of the impacts of the MoBE on mental health. Depending on the specific microbial species involved, the transfer of microorganisms from the built environment to occupant’s cutaneous or mucosal membranes has the potential to increase or disrupt immunoregulation and/or exaggerate or suppress inflammation. Preclinical evidence highlighting the influence of the microbiota on systemic inflammation supports the assertion that microorganisms, including those originating from the built environment, have the potential to either increase or decrease the risk of inflammation-induced psychiatric conditions and their symptom severity. With advanced understanding of both the ecology of the built environment, and its influence on the human microbiome, it may be possible to develop bioinformed strategies for management of the built environment to promote mental health. Here we present a brief summary of microbiome research in both areas and highlight two interdependencies including the following: (1) effects of the MoBE on the human microbiome and (2) potential opportunities for manipulation of the MoBE in order to improve mental health. In addition, we propose future research directions including strategies for assessment of changes in the microbiome of common areas of built environments shared by multiple human occupants, and associated cohort-level changes in the mental health of those who spend time in the buildings. Overall, our understanding of the fields of both the MoBE and influence of host-associated microorganisms on mental health are advancing at a rapid pace and, if linked, could offer considerable benefit to health and wellness."
1,The Effect of Lean-Seafood and Non-Seafood Diets on Fecal Metabolites and Gut Microbiome: Results from a Randomized Crossover Intervention Study,"SCOPE: The impact of dietary protein types on the gut microbiome is scarcely studied. The aim of the present study is therefore to examine the effects of lean-seafood and non-seafood proteins on the gut microbiome composition and activity and elucidate potential associations to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. \ METHODS: A crossover intervention study in which 20 healthy subjects consumed two diets that varied in protein source was conducted. 1 H NMR spectroscopy and 16S rDNA sequencing analyses were applied to characterize fecal metabolites and gut microbiota composition, respectively. \ RESULTS: A twofold increase in fecal trimethylamine excretion was observed after the lean-seafood diet period. Circulating TAG and the total to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio as well as circulating TMAO levels were each associated with specific gut bacteria. Following the non-seafood diet period, a decreased relative abundance of Clostridium cluster IV and a tendency toward an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio were found. \ CONCLUSIONS: Lean-seafood and non-seafood diets differentially modulate the gut microbiome composition and activity. Furthermore, the gut microbiota composition seems to affect circulating TMAO levels and CVD risk factors."
2,Does thinking about Einstein make people entity theorists? Examining the malleability of creative mindsets.,"People differ in how they define creativity. Some people see it as malleable and possible to be developed (so-called growth mindset). Others view creativity as a stable and largely unchangeable characteristic (fixed mindset). In this article, we explore whether and to what extent creative mindsets change when everyday (little-c) or eminent (Big-C) creativity categories are experimentally activated by having participants (N = 501) read short descriptions of everyday and eminent creativity. Consistent with our predictions, thinking about renowned creators (the Big-C condition) led participants to exhibit stronger fixed beliefs compared to when they read descriptions of less prominent, little-c creativity. A reversed pattern was observed in the case of growth mindsets. Specifically, growth mindsets increased when little-c creativity was activated but decreased in the Big-C condition. We discuss implications of our findings for theory, research, and practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
1,Tongue coating microbiome data distinguish patients with pancreatic head cancer from healthy controls,"Background: The microbiota plays a critical role in the process of human carcinogenesis. Pancreatic head carcinoma (PHC)-associated tongue coating microbiome dysbiosis has not yet been clearly defined.Objective: Our aim is to reveal the bacterial composition shifts in the microbiota of the tongue coat of PHC patients.Design: The tongue coating microbiota was analyzed in 30 PHC patients and 25 healthy controls using 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology.Results: The microbiome diversity of the tongue coat in PHC patients was significantly increased, as shown by the Shannon, Simpson, inverse Simpson, Obs and incidence-based coverage estimators. Principal component analysis revealed that PHC patients were colonized by remarkably different tongue coating microbiota than healthy controls and liver cancer patients. Linear discriminant analysis effect size revealed that Leptotrichia, Fusobacterium,Rothia, Actinomyces, Corynebacterium, Atopobium, Peptostreptococcus, Catonella, Oribacterium, Filifactor, Campylobacter, Moraxella and Tannerella were overrepresented in the tongue coating of PHC patients, and Haemophilus, Porphyromonas and Paraprevotella were enriched in the tongue coating microbiota of healthy controls. Strikingly, Haemophilus, Porphyromonas, Leptotrichia and Fusobacterium could distinguish PHC patients from healthy subjects, and Streptococcus and SR1 could distinguish PHC patients from liver cancer patients. Conclusions: These findings identified the microbiota dysbiosis of the tongue coat in PHC patients, and provide insight into the association between the human microbiome and pancreatic cancer."

The first example is the use of mRNA quantification showing that nitrification processes are indeed very susceptible to some pesticides, and that there is correlation between the mRNA transcript quantity and the nitrification rate. The second example is devoted to pesticides influencing microbial community structures. The emergence of high throughput sequencing techniques now allows a more detailed analysis of which bacterial species are influenced."
3,Asthma costs and social impact,"In recent decades, both asthma prevalence and incidence have been increasing worldwide, not only due to the genetic background, but mainly because of the effect of a wide number of environmental and lifestyle risk factors., In many countries noncommunicable diseases, like asthma, are not yet considered a healthcare priority. This review will analyze and discuss disparities in asthma management in several countries and regions, such as access to healthcare human resources and medications, due to limited financial capacity to develop strategies to control and prevent this chronic disease., This review tries to explore the social and economic burden of asthma impact on society. Although asthma is generally accepted as a costly illness, the total costs to society (direct, indirect and intangible asthma costs) are difficult to estimate, mainly due to different disease definitions and characterizations but also to the use of different methodologies to assess the asthma socio-economic impact in different societies., The asthma costs are very variables from country to country, however we can estimate that a mean cost per patient per year, including all asthmatics (intermittent, mild, moderate and severe asthma) in Europe is $USD 1,900, which seems lower than USA, estimated mean $USD 3,100."
3,Differences in sexual identity dimensions between bisexual and other sexual minority individuals: Implications for minority stress and mental health.,"Bisexual individuals experience poorer mental health than other sexual minority individuals. One explanation for this is that biphobia predisposes bisexual individuals to have a more ambiguous sexual identity and fewer opportunities for stress-ameliorating forms of coping and support. This study explores sexual identity and sexual identity dimensions—prominence, valence, integration, and complexity—in bisexual and other sexual minority individuals. We describe differences in sexual identity dimensions between bisexual and other sexual minority individuals and test two explanations for mental health disparities between them: whether sexual identity dimensions directly impact mental health and whether they moderate the impact of stress on mental health. Data came from a longitudinal study of a diverse sample of sexual minority individuals (N = 396, 71 bisexual respondents) sampled from community venues in New York City. Sexual identity was prominent for both bisexual and other sexual minority individuals, but bisexual individuals reported lower valence and integration of sexual identity in their identity structures. The hypothesis that sexual identity dimensions moderate the impact of minority stress on mental health was not supported. After several longitudinal assessments, however, we concluded that identity valence (but not integration or complexity) and depressive symptoms were bidirectionally associated so that differences in valence between bisexual and other sexual minority individuals explained, in part, disparities in depressive symptoms.

3,"Joint effects of pregnancy, sociocultural, and environmental factors on ear...: EBSCOhost","The joint impact of pregnancy, environmental, and sociocultural exposures on early life gut microbiome is not yet well-characterized, especially in racially and socioeconomically diverse populations. Gut microbiota of 298 children from a Detroit-based birth cohort were profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing: 130 neonates (median age = 1.2 months) and 168 infants (median age = 6.6 months). Multiple factors were associated with neonatal gut microbiome composition in both single- and multi-factor models, with independent contributions of maternal race-ethnicity, breastfeeding, mode of delivery, marital status, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and indoor pets. These findings were consistent in the infants, and networks demonstrating the shared impact of factors on gut microbial composition also showed notable topological similarity between neonates and infants. Further, latent groups defined by these factors explained additional variation, highlighting the importance of combinatorial effects. Our findings also have implications for studies investigating the impact of the early life gut microbiota on disease."
3,Child protective services decision-making: The role of children’s race and county factors.,"The current study investigates the role of race and county characteristics in substantiation and out-of-home placement decisions in the United States. Using multilevel models, we analyzed data from counties in the United States available through the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data Systems and Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System to investigate the interactions between children’s race and the context in which they live. Our sample consisted exclusively of children whose cases had been investigated; therefore, we were able to focus on the role played by race and county characteristics in substantiation and out-of-home placement decisions made by Child Protective Services, net of the heightened risk factors (or potential biases) that lead to disparate rates of reporting. Adjusting for state and county of investigation, Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and multiracial children were more likely than White (non-Hispanic) children to be substantiated or placed out of home, whereas Asian children were less likely to be substantiated or placed out of home. Notably, differences across groups are far smaller in magnitude when demographic and geographic differences are taken into account. Higher county-level poverty, percentages of Black residents, and juvenile arrest rates were associated with lower odds of substantiation and out-of-home placement among investigated children, whereas an elevated percentage of single-headed households was associated with higher odds of both outcomes. We also found that living in a rural county was associated with greater odds of substantiation but lower odds of out-of-home placement. Important differences by race were found for these associations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,The Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale (TSES) factorial structure evidence review and new evidence from Polish-speaking samples.,"The Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale (TSES) is a widely accepted and enthusiastically used measurement instrument. Unfortunately, little firm evidence is available to support its factorial structure. The article reports on the results of the TSES administered to large representative samples of primary (2,083) and lower-secondary school teachers (2,382) in Poland, along with the results of reanalyzed US data, based on which the scale was developed. The results support TSES as a reliable instrument applicable across countries. However, they also highlight the importance of analyzing the factorial structure of the scale with each application, as it may require modifications when administered to different samples. Additionally, moderate evidence was found in Polish data for TSES to be invariant between primary and lower-secondary school teachers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,What matters: Factors impacting the recovery process among outpatient mental health service users.,"Objective: Understanding factors that promote and hinder the recovery process for people living with serious mental illness remains of critical importance. We examine factors, including limited literacy, associated with mental health recovery among public mental health service users. Method: This study uses data from a mixed-methods, service-user informed project focused on the impact of limited literacy in the lives of people with serious mental illness. Data from structured interviews evaluate perceptions of recovery as assessed with the Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS). Regression models examine factors related to recovery controlling for sociodemographic factors, literacy, neurocognition, mental health status, perceived social support, and stigma. Results: Despite bivariate relationships between RAS and limited literacy, the full models suggest that other factors account for this relationship. These include mental health status, higher social support, higher self-reported community status, and higher stigma consciousness, as well as race for some models. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Our findings that social support and perceptions of community status are associated with higher scores on the RAS echo prior work demonstrating the importance of social connection and context in mental health recovery. Though literacy was not a predictor of recovery, further research should examine the relationship between literacy and recovery given the deep literature on literacy on health outcomes. In order to better support people in the recovery process it is important that more research is done to examine the complex relationship between stigma consciousness and recovery as well as understand the racial disparities that exist within the recovery subscales.

3,Delayed differentiation of vaginal and uterine microbiomes in dairy cows developing postpartum endometritis,"Bacterial overgrowth in the uterus is a normal event after parturition. In contrast to the healthy cow, animals unable to control the infection within 21 days after calving develop postpartum endometritis. Studies on the Microbial Ecology of the bovine reproductive tract have focused on either vaginal or uterine microbiomes. This is the first study that compares both microbiomes in the same animals. Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism of the 16S rRNA gene showed that despite large differences associated to individuals, a shared community exist in vagina and uterus during the postpartum period. The largest changes associated with development of endometritis were observed at 7 days postpartum, a time when vaginal and uterine microbiomes were most similar. 16S rRNA pyrosequencing of the vaginal microbiome at 7 days postpartum showed at least three different microbiome types that were associated with later development of postpartum endometritis. All three microbiome types featured reduced bacterial diversity. Taken together, the above findings support a scenario where disruption of the compartmentalization of the reproductive tract during parturition results in the dispersal and mixing of the vaginal and uterine microbiomes, which subsequently are subject to differentiation. This differentiation was observed early postpartum in the healthy cow. In contrast, loss of bacterial diversity and dominance of the microbiome by few bacterial taxa were related to a delayed succession at 7DPP in cows that at 21 DPP or later were diagnosed with endometritis.;"
3,Race differences in the receipt of mental health services among young adults.,"This study investigates race and ethnic differences in the receipt of mental health services among young adults. Research has indicated that racial minorities receive treatment at a much lower rate than those with middle and upper incomes and Whites. We use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a nationally representative study of young adults, first interviewed when in Grades 7 through 12. We find significant differences across race-ethnicity. Consistent with prior research, Blacks are less likely to have received mental health services. Findings for gender and education differed from previous studies. The relationship of gender on services receipt is mediated by depression. The relationship of race-ethnicity on services receipt is moderated by levels of education and prior services use. Education is associated with greater services use for Whites, but less services use for Blacks. Also, Blacks who used services in the past are significantly less likely to be current users. The implications of these results are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

2,Phonological encoding in the oral but not manual Stroop task: Evidence for the role of a speech production process.,"The present study investigated how response mode (oral vs. manual) modulates the Stroop effect using a picture variant of the Stroop task in which participants named orally, or identified with a manual keypress, line drawings of animals (e.g., camel). Consistent with previous color-response Stroop studies, relative to the nonlinguistic neutral distractor (a row of “#” symbols), incongruent distractors (e.g., GIRAFFE) interfered with responding to pictures, and that interference was reduced for the manual, compared with the oral, response. Additionally, pseudoword distractors with no phonological overlap with the picture name (e.g., NUST–camel) interfered with the oral, but not the manual, response. The novel finding is that relative to this pseudoword distractor, the oral response was facilitated when the distractor shared the onset segment with the picture name, regardless of orthographic overlap (e.g., CUST–camel = KUST–camel < NUST–camel); in contrast, for the manual response, there was no difference between the three pseudoword distractor conditions. These results are explained in terms of phonological encoding, a speech production process involved in computing a phonetic plan for generating an oral, but not a manual, response.

3,Bayesian models for semicontinuous outcomes in rolling admission therapy groups.,"Alcohol and other drug abuse are frequently treated in a group therapy setting. If participants are allowed to enroll in therapy on a rolling basis, irregular patterns of participant overlap can induce complex correlations of participant outcomes. Previous work has accounted for common session attendance by modeling random effects for each therapy session, which map to participant outcomes via a multiple membership construction when modeling normally distributed outcome measures. We build on this earlier work by extending the models to semicontinuous outcomes, or outcomes that are a mixture of continuous and discrete distributions. This results in multivariate session effects, for which we allow temporal dependencies of various orders. We illustrate our methods using data from a group-based intervention to treat substance abuse and depression, focusing on the outcome of average number of drinks per day. Alcohol and other drug abuse are frequently treated in a group therapy setting. If 2 clients attend the some of the same sessions, we might expect that—on average—their posttreatment outcomes would be more similar than if they had not attended any sessions together. Hence, if participants are allowed to enroll in therapy on a rolling basis, irregular patterns of session attendance can induce complex relationships between participant outcomes. Statistical methods have been developed previously to account for rolling admission group therapy when the outcomes are normally distributed. In the case of alcohol and other drug use interventions, however, a substantial fraction of participants often report zero use after treatment. We extend previous work to build models that accommodate semicontinuous outcomes, which are a mixture of continuous and discrete distributions, for such situations. We find that modern Bayesian statistical methods and software allow users to efficiently estimate nonstandard models such as these. We illustrate our methods using data from a group-based intervention to treat substance abuse and depression, focusing on the outcome of average number of drinks per day. We find that the intervention is associated with a drop in the probability of any drinking, but find no evidence of a change in the amount of drinking, conditional on some drinking.

1,Early colonization of the gut microbiome and its relationship with obesity,"Adult and childhood obesity rates are increasing. Childhood obesity, in particular, is a complicated, multifactorial condition that is not always explained by overeating. To address rising rates of obesity, researchers have begun to address how the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome influences metabolism, energy absorption, and weight regulation. Colonization of the gut begins in early life and is highly influenced by method of birth (vaginal versus Caesarean), method of feeding (formula feeding versus breastfeeding), and exposure to antibiotics. Not surprisingly, an infant’s gut microbiome is very likely to resemble that of its mother. However, this means that aberrant bacteria characterized by an obese microbiome can also get passed on from an obese mom to child. To promote the colonization of a healthy infant gut microbiome, the optimal strategy generally is to have a vaginal delivery followed by exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age with minimal exposure to antibiotics. However, this is not always possible and overweight or obese mothers risk passing on aberrant bacteria to her children. In such cases, in conjunction with medical professionals, women can consider adding pre- and probiotics to their diets during pregnancy and lactation as well as other mitigation strategies. The colonization of an infant’s gut with optimal bacteria may help reduce the risk of obesity later in life."
2,The gut microbiome correlates with conspecific aggression in a small population of rescued dogs (Canis familiaris),"Aggression is a serious behavioral disorder in domestic dogs that endangers both dogs and humans. The underlying causes of canine aggression are poorly resolved and require illumination to ensure effective therapy. Recent research links the compositional diversity of the gut microbiome to behavioral and psychological regulation in other mammals, such as mice and humans. Given these observations, we hypothesized that the composition of the canine gut microbiome could associate with aggression. We analyzed fecal microbiome samples collected from a small population of pit bull type dogs seized from a dogfighting organization. This population included 21 dogs that displayed conspecific aggressive behaviors and 10 that did not. Beta-diversity analyses support an association between gut microbiome structure and dog aggression. Additionally, we used a phylogenetic approach to resolve specific clades of gut bacteria that stratify aggressive and non-aggressive dogs, including clades within Lactobacillus, Dorea, Blautia, Turicibacter, and Bacteroides. Several of these taxa have been implicated in modulating mammalian behavior as well as gastrointestinal disease states. Although sample size limits this study, our findings indicate that gut microorganisms are linked to dog aggression and point to an aggression-associated physiological state that interacts with the gut microbiome. These results also indicate that the gut microbiome may be useful for diagnosing aggressive behaviors prior to their manifestation and potentially discerning cryptic etiologies of aggression."
1,Global Consequences of Land Use,"Land use has generally been considered a local environmental issue, but it is becoming a force of global importance. Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term."
2,Attempted prime retrieval is a double-edged sword: Facilitation and disruption in repeated lexical retrieval.,"The phenomenological experience of lexical retrieval often involves repeated, active attempts to retrieve phonologically and/or semantically related information. However, the influence of these multiple retrieval attempts on subsequent lexical retrieval is presently unknown. We investigated the influence of passively viewing or actively retrieving different types of information at the critical moment preceding lexical retrieval through a novel priming paradigm. Participants attempted to retrieve target words (e.g., abdicate) from low-frequency descriptions (e.g., to formally renounce a throne). Target retrieval was preceded by passive viewing (Experiment 1), or active retrieval of the prime word (Experiments 2–6). Primes were either “both” semantically and phonologically related (e.g., abandon), only phonologically related (e.g., abdomen), only semantically related (e.g., resign), or unrelated (e.g., obvious) to the target word. When primes were passively viewed, phonological facilitation in target retrieval accuracy was observed. In contrast, when participants actively attempted to retrieve primes from their definitions, no phonological facilitation was observed. Successful retrieval of semantic and both primes facilitated subsequent target retrieval, whereas, failure to retrieve semantic and both primes inhibited subsequent target retrieval. These facilitatory and inhibitory influences of prime retrieval for semantic and both primes were independent of feedback on retrieval performance (Experiment 4) and participants’ overall knowledge of the primes and targets (Experiment 5), and also did not extend to retrieval from episodic memory (Experiment 6). The findings are consistent with ongoing retrospective processes during target retrieval, which reengage prime retrieval success or failure and consequently produce benefits and costs during repeated retrieval from semantic memory.

Here, rumen microbiomes of beef cattle (n = 48) from three breeds (Angus, Charolais, Kinsella composite hybrid) with high and low feed efficiency were explored using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, aiming to identify differences between functional potentials and activities of same rumen microbiomes and to evaluate the effects of host breed and feed efficiency on the rumen microbiome."
3,Validating the Polish adaptation of the 11-item De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale.,"The aim of this study was to translate into Polish and establish the psychometric properties of the 11-item De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS). The translation process followed the recent guidelines for the crosscultural adaptation of questionnaires and was tested through analysis of differential item functioning (DIF) by the use of the Poly-SIBTEST method and bilingual groups. The essential unidimensionality was checked by bifactor analysis. Reliability was assessed by internal consistency and homogeneity analysis, and external construct validity by correlation with several external scales. The research indicated no differences in item performance between the final Polish and English versions, and confirmed the earlier findings indicating that the DJGLS measures two dimensions of loneliness (social and emotional) which generalize into a higher-order factor of a general sense of loneliness (bifactor structure). Reliability (α = .89) and homogeneity (H = .47) proved to be high. Research showed that the instrument has a satisfactory validity criterion: Correlation with the UCLA Loneliness Scale r = .82; with Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Scale r = –.56; and with the Beck Depression Inventory r = .46 (all p < .01). The Polish adaptation of the DJGLS thus presents a bifactor structure, with good levels of internal consistency, homogeneity, and construct validity.

1,The vermiform appendix: an immunological organ sustaining a microbiome inoculum,"The hominoid vermiform appendix has been characterized as a diverticulum of the caecum and describes an entity at the juxtaposition of the colon in the confluence of tanias. The independent development of the lymphoid follicle centres of the appendix is progressed at birth in the presence of the intestinal commensal microbiome, an obligatory prompt for the diversification of intestinal and extra-intestinal mucosal immunological tissue. In the vermiform appendix, this activity is centred on further developing the inventory of primary antibodies and the maturation of T- and B-lymphocyte cells in the follicles within the lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, the columnar epithelia, enterocytes and goblet cells comprise the complement of cells that occupy the lamina propria and muscularis mucosae of the vermiform appendix’s mucosa, while macrophages and an abundance of immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G generating plasma cells seed the lamina propria. Intraepithelial immune cells consisting predominantly of specific CD8+ T regulatory lymphocytes occupy sites in the appendix analogous to those present in the intestinal epithelia of the caecal colon. The complement of bacterial genera concealed in the vermiform appendix is posited extant as a biofilm inoculum of the intestinal commensal microbiome. This facilitates re-inoculation of the proximal colon and to a lesser degree the terminal ilium post an intestinal perturbation such as occurs with daily lifestyle stressors, dietary choices and the short-term administration of antibiotics rather than an infectious fulminant colitis. A plausible appreciation results of the importance of multiple immunological aspects of a healthy vermiform appendix and the provision of a commensal biofilm to the gut that repairs a dysbiotic microbiome contributing to balancing intestinal pro- and anti-inflammatory activity for maintaining homeostasis in the gut. Since the composition of the gut microbiome can vary over the short-term and long-term, it is plausible that the appendix inoculum may be instrumental in maintaining the intestinal microbiome."
3,Emergency medical services and “psych calls”: Examining the work of urban EMS providers.,"Emergency medical technicians and paramedics form the backbone of the United States’ Emergency Medical Service (EMS) system. Despite the frequent involvement of EMS with people with mental health and substance abuse problems, the nature and content of this work, as well as how EMS providers think about this work, have not been fully explored. Using data obtained through observations and interviews with providers at an urban American EMS agency, this paper provides an analysis of the ways in which EMS providers interact with people with mental illness and substance abuse problems, as well as providers’ experiences with the mental health care system. Results demonstrate that EMS providers share common beliefs and frustrations about “psych calls” and the types of calls that involve people with behavioral health problems. In addition, providers described their understandings of the ways in which people with mental health and substance use problems “abuse the system” and the consequences of this abuse. Finally, EMS providers discuss the system-level factors that impact their work and specific barriers and challenges to care. These results suggest that additional work is needed to expand our understanding of the role of EMS providers in the care of people with behavioral health problems and that mental health practitioners and policy makers should include consideration of the important role of EMS and prehospital care in providing community-based supports for people with behavioral health needs.

2,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on community-dwelling caregivers and persons with dementia.,"Restrictions related to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pose unique and significant challenges for community-dwelling caregivers and people with dementia, including disrupted routines, a lack of structure, decreased access to respite care, and new or worsening safety issues related to interpersonal violence and hygiene. In addition to identifying issues confronting caregivers, the authors also describe possible ways to address some of these pressing concerns.

3,A behavior analytic perspective on victimology.,"The field of victimology has become an area of serious scientific enquiry only recently and now attracts a wide range of theories from within multiple disciplines. In this paper the contribution that the science of behavior analysis can make to the conceptualization of the field is explored by investigating what makes people vulnerable to becoming victims or indeed perpetrators of violence and by examining why some people who have experienced violent incidents become victims while others grow to be survivors. A behavior analytic perspective sheds new light on these issues. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"

3,Psychological impact of long-term political violence: An exploration of community service users.,"Politically motivated violence has been a hallmark of life in Northern Ireland for the past 37 years. Despite the ceasefires in 1994 to 1995, violent incidents remain a relatively common occurrence. A range of community-based services developed to help people cope. In this article, the psychological health of people who use these services is assessed by means of the General Health Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Index, and the Post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale. Pearson correlations indicate that 10 years after the ceasefires in Northern Ireland, the psychological health of community service users remains compromised in terms of death, individual, social, and cultural contexts. These issues are discussed in relation to questions regarding the effects of ongoing violence, resilience, and effectiveness of services. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,Nonevent stress contributes to mental health disparities based on sexual orientation: Evidence from a personal projects analysis.,"This study examined the role of nonevent stress—in the form of frustrated personal project pursuits in the arenas of relationships and work—as a contributing factor to mental health disparities between heterosexual and lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations. A purposive sample of 431 LGB (55%) and heterosexually identified (45%) individuals living in the United States and Canada completed the Personal Project Inventory by describing and rating core personal projects they were pursuing. The intensity of perceived barriers to the achievement of relationship- and work-related personal projects served as indicators nonevent stress. Hierarchical linear regression models tested the hypothesis that nonevent stress contributes to the association between sexual orientation and two indicators of mental health: depressive symptoms and psychological well-being. LGB individuals had significantly more depressive symptoms and lower levels of psychological well-being than heterosexuals. Indicators of nonevent stress were significantly associated with mental health outcomes and their inclusion in models attenuated sexual orientation differences in mental health. The critical indirect pathway leading from sexual minority status to mental health occurred via barriers to relationship projects from interpersonal sources. This research suggests that nonevent stress because of structural and interpersonal stigma may contribute to mental health disparities between LGB and heterosexual individuals. The findings have important implications for policy reform around same-sex relationship recognition and workplace discrimination. Future research and clinical work will benefit by expanding existing foci on stress to include nonevent stressors to better understand and address mental health problems, particularly in LGB populations.

1,Plant microbiome-dependent immune enhancing action of Echinacea purpurea is enhanced by soil organic matter content,"We previously demonstrated that extracts from Echinacea purpurea material varied substantially in their ability to activate macrophages in vitro and that this variation was due to differences in their content of bacterial components. The purpose of the current study was to identify soil conditions (organic matter, nitrogen, and moisture content) that alter the macrophage activation potential of E. purpurea and determine whether these changes in activity correspond to shifts in the plant-associated microbiome. Increased levels of soil organic matter significantly enhanced macrophage activation exhibited by the root extracts of E. purpurea (p < 0.0001). A change in soil organic matter content from 5.6% to 67.4% led to a 4.2-fold increase in the macrophage activation potential of extracts from E. purpurea. Bacterial communities also differed significantly between root materials cultivated in soils with different levels of organic matter (p < 0.001). These results indicate that the level of soil organic matter is an agricultural factor that can alter the bacterial microbiome, and thereby the activity, of E. purpurea roots. Since ingestion of bacterial preparation (e.g., probiotics) is reported to impact human health, it is likely that the medicinal value of Echinacea is influenced by cultivation conditions that alter its associated bacterial community."
3,Review of Experience sampling method: Measuring the quality of everyday life.,"Reviews the book, Experience sampling method: Measuring the quality of everyday life by Joel M. Hektner, Jennifer Schmidt, and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (see record 2006-11885-000). The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) involves having respondents answer questions when prompted randomly by watches, pagers, or palm pilots during the course of a day over a period of time such as a week. Responding to items on predetermined forms, individuals describe what they are doing, what they wish they could be doing, who they are with, and how they feel. Unlike life experiences simulated in laboratories, the ESM captures the experiences and feelings of people, and the time they allocate to different activities as they occur in their everyday lives. This very readable book is the first and most complete rendition to examine why the ESM is especially valuable for the study of human behavior and how to conduct such an investigation from sample selection to analyses and interpretation of the results. Written as an introductory text for social scientists, the book is divided into three major sections. The first section reviews the epistemological foundation of the ESM. Section two provides the researcher with a clear and detailed toolkit for designing, fielding, coding, and analyzing an ESM study. The last section of the book discusses how the ESM has been used in social science research. If we are to learn more about the emotionality of our lives, this book offers a scientifically sound and creative method for doing so. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
3,Families experiencing housing instability: The effects of housing programs on family routines and rituals.,"Maintenance of family processes can protect parents, children, and families from the detrimental effects of extreme stressors, such as homelessness. When families cannot maintain routines and rituals, the stressors of poverty and homelessness can be compounded for both caregivers and children. However, characteristics of living situations common among families experiencing homelessness present barriers to the maintenance of family routines and rituals. We analyzed 80 in-depth interviews with parents who were experiencing or had recently experienced an instance of homelessness. We compared their assessments of challenges to family schedules, routines, and rituals across various living situations, including shelter, transitional housing programs, doubled-up (i.e., living temporarily with family or friends), and independent housing. Rules common across shelters and transitional housing programs impeded family processes, and parents felt surveilled and threatened with child protective service involvement in these settings. In doubled-up living situations, parents reported adapting their routines to those of the household and having parenting interrupted by opinions of friends and family members. Families used several strategies to maintain family routines and rituals in these living situations and ensure consistency and stability for their children during an otherwise unstable time.

1,Systemic proinflammation after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was correlated to the gut microbiome in HIV-uninfected humans,"BACKGROUND: The dysbiosis of gut microbiome and interaction with host immunity after Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection are under-investigation. We had found fatigue symptom concurrent with dysbiosis by decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B ratio) in active tuberculosis (TB). The study aims to assess the inflammatory biomarkers and their interaction with gut microbiome in active TB and latent TB infection before starting anti-TB regimens. \ MATERIALS AND METHOD: Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1B), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) releasing assay (IGRA) were measured in 25 active TB patients, 32 LTBI subjects, and 23 healthy controls (HC). Gut microbiome profiles were obtained using 16S rRNA MiSeq sequencing method. \ RESULTS: The leukocytosis (7008±383 cell/cum, p<0.05), increase in IL-6 (229.7±104μg/dL, p<0.05), and decrease in IL-4 (0.27μg/dL±0.1, p<0.05) were presented in active TB. The proportion of polymorphic neutrophil (PMN) in peripheral blood was positively related to the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in LTBI and active TB (R2 =0.23, p<0.05). The F/B ratio was positively related to the detectable IL-1B in TB (R2 =0.97, p<0.01) and to the IL-4 in LTBI (R2 =0.27, p<0.05). In LTBI, the relative abundances of Coriobacteriales was positively related to the secretion of IFN-gamma against TB antigens more likely associated with of CD4+ T cell (R2 =0.42, p<0.05). \ CONCLUSION: In active TB, dysbiosis with higher relative abundances of Bacteroidetes in stool and low F/B ratio was related to systemic proinflammation. In LTBI, dose-response relationship between peripheral PMN and relative abundances of Bacteroidetes was remained but not lead to systemic inflammation. This article is protected by copyright.

3,"Suicidal ideation in ethnic minority and majority adolescents in Utrecht, the Netherlands.","We investigated the prevalence and explored the vulnerability to suicidal ideation across several ethnic minority versus ethnic majority adolescents in the city of Utrecht in The Netherlands. Exploratory analyses were conducted on a dataset obtained from the Municipal Health Services in Utrecht. We examined whether ethnic minority adolescents are at risk for suicidal ideation because of a family background of migration, social-economic position and certain family factors, which influence psychological constellations. We found that levels of suicidal ideation among adolescents of Turkish background were significantly higher than in both majority and other minority adolescents. The Turkish adolescents at risk for suicidal ideation reported that they do not enjoy being at home with their families. Psychological factors, in particular lack of self-pride and the idea of not becoming successful in life, appeared to be important, as well as feelings of loneliness. Suicidal ideation was not found equally across all ethnic minority groups. A history of migration, ethnic minority status, or low socioeconomic status were not sufficient to explain the variation across ethnicities. Our results suggest that specific social-cultural factors, contextualized in the individual and located in the family environment, are relevant in explaining the disproportionate rates for Turkish adolescents in Utrecht.

2,Creating emotional false recollections: Perceptual recombination and conceptual fluency mechanisms.,"We investigated the impact of 2 hypothetical mechanisms of episodic memory reconstruction—perceptual recombination and conceptual fluency—on objectively measured recollection accuracy and false recollections of neutral and emotional stimuli. Participants encoded negative, neutral, and positive pictures depicting objects and scenes (i.e., target pictures), each accompanied with a descriptive verbal label (e.g., “boy crying at funeral,” “wooden basket on floor,” “four chimpanzees laughing together”). Next, they encoded fragmented pictures of some of the scenes they did and did not earlier see (perceptual misinformation), or they received multiple presentations of the corresponding verbal labels (conceptual misinformation). Recollection of target pictures was then tested, using labels as retrieval cues. We had three key findings in each of two experiments. First, as in our prior work, both perceptual and conceptual misinformation significantly increased false recollection judgments of nonstudied pictures, including high-confidence errors. These effects implicate perceptual recombination and conceptual fluency mechanisms. Second, these misinformation effects generalized across all emotional categories, implicating separable roles of these two mechanisms on emotional recollections. Finally, conceptual misinformation was less likely to influence negative than neutral recollection errors, providing new evidence that emotion can improve retrieval monitoring accuracy and reduce false memories based on conceptual fluency (i.e., an emotional distinctiveness heuristic).

2,"Attention, impulsivity, and vigilance in agenesis of the corpus callosum.","Objective: Questions regarding the role of the corpus callosum in attention are raised by the reports of attention problems in some persons with agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC), as well as by abnormalities in callosal size in persons with attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder. The current study assessed inattention, impulsivity, and vigilance in individuals with AgCC. Method: These domains of attention were assessed using the Conners’ Continuous Performance Test II in 18 older adolescents and adults (ages 16–52) with complete AgCC and normal intelligence (full scale intelligence quotient > 80). Scores were converted to T scores using age-specific norms and assessed for departure from the normative sample. Results: Scores were significantly elevated in older adolescents with AgCC for errors of commission (p = .050, d = 0.55) and detectability (p = .03, d = 0.58). Older adolescents were worse than adults for commissions (p = .06, ηp² = .201) and detectability (p = .03, ηp² = .273). Also, male individuals had significantly higher (worse) scores than did female in vigilance (p = .01, ηp² = .337). Conclusion: These results suggest moderate levels of difficulties in sustained attention in AgCC, particularly in maintaining response inhibition and in vigilance, that are modulated by age and sex.

2,Constellations of family risk for long-term adolescent antisocial behavior.,"Adolescent antisocial behavior (ASB) can have long-term individual and societal consequences. Much of the research on the development of ASB considers risk and protective factors in isolation or as cumulative indices, likely overlooking the co-occurring and interacting nature of these factors. Guided by theories of ASB risk (i.e., coercive family process, disengagement), this study uses latent profile analysis to evaluate whether there are subgroups of families in the population that conform to specific constellations of risk factors prescribed by established theories of risk for ASB, and whether subgroup membership confers differential risk for different ASBs. We leveraged a large sample of adolescents in Fall, Grade 6 (N = 5,300; Mage = 11.8; 50.9% female) for subgroup analysis, and predicted aggression, antisocial peer behavior, and substance use in Spring, Grade 8. Four family profiles were identified: Coercive (15%), characterized by high family conflict, low positive family climate, low parental involvement, low effective discipline, low adolescent positive engagement, and low parental knowledge; Disengaged (41%), characterized by low positive family climate, low parental involvement, low adolescent positive engagement, and low parental knowledge; Permissive (11%), characterized by high parental involvement, low effective discipline, high adolescent positive engagement, high parental knowledge, and high family conflict; and High Functioning (34% prevalence). In turn, group membership predicted long-term outcomes. Adolescents in Coercive families were at highest risk for ASB during Grade 8, followed by those in Disengaged and Permissive profiles; all three of which were at greater risk than adolescents in High Functioning families for every outcome.

1,Childhood asthma hospitalization risk after cesarean delivery in former term and premature infants,"Background \ Cesarean delivery modifies infant gut bacterial flora composition, which may result in hindered tolerance to allergenic substances, thereby increasing the risk of asthma in accordance with the hygiene hypothesis. Results of previous studies regarding an association between birth route and asthma are conflicting, and these studies have not evaluated some potential confounding effects, including prematurity and maternal asthma. \ Objective \ To determine whether cesarean delivery in full-term and premature infants increases the risk of subsequent childhood asthma hospitalization. \ Methods \ We conducted a case-control study using the Washington State Birth Events Record Database linked to statewide hospitalization data. The study included 2,028 children hospitalized for asthma (cases) and 8,292 age-matched controls. \ Results \ Cesarean delivery was modestly associated with an increased risk of asthma hospitalization (odds ratio [OR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.39). However, when analyzed separately, there was an association between cesarean delivery and asthma hospitalization in premature infants (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.09-3.02) but not in full-term infants (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.97-1.34). \ Conclusions \ Cesarean delivery was associated with subsequent asthma hospitalization only in premature infants. Because mothers with asthma are reported to have increased rates of cesarean delivery and premature delivery, other factors in addition to the hygiene hypothesis, including genetic and in utero influences associated with maternal asthma, may contribute to the increased risk of asthma in premature infants."
